Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006\u20132016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits. Lower income groups are exposed to rent increases, though this is offset by social housing, which remains the most prevalent tenure in Inner London for low income classes.", "partners": "1.

We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010\u20132050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.", "partners": "J.

They found that from 1786 to 1920 the city was multifractal, that is, it had a heterogeneous distribution of street intersections with just as many areas having a lot as having only a few. After 1920, the network gradually lost its multifractality, and by 2010 it had become nearly monofractal with a homogeneous distribution dominated by regions with multiple intersections. The authors argue that the loss of multifractality was caused by the \u201cgreen belt\u201d of countryside around the city, which was introduced in the mid-1950s to contain urban sprawl. This led to the network only being able to expand by filling in the space delimited by the belt.

Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node- place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification- diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node-place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension \u2013 design \u2013 into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment.

Citizen participation rates are usually low, implying that they may feel this way too. There are two good reasons for this feeling: On the one hand, public consultation often only occurs when it is a mandatory exercise required by government for development approval; on the other, when public consultation occurs it is after much time and effort has been invested by professionals to develop a scheme therefore change is made reluctantly or not at all. These factors create a reactionary and adversarial atmosphere during consultation. These structural limitations mean that there is no time to find alignment of interests between project developers and the public, or to develop trust and collaborations. This article explores how codesign games as a form of public participation can be done at an early stage of project development to contribute to finding alignment of interests and collaborations between project developers and different public interests.

Planning agencies and traditional territory-based arrangements are viewed with increasing suspicion, as standing in the way of investment and acting as a brake on much needed house-building and regeneration.

We show that perspectives and imaginations of planning and regulation are more complex and that many firms have realised that market success results from becoming more deeply embedded in the local political, social, and regulatory environments in which they are investing. A greater understanding of these multiple forms of calculation, in turn, opens up opportunities for the maintenance and/or implementation of more effective forms of territorially-based soft and hard regulation.

In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demon- strate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning \u2013 being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features.

Mobility indices were computed based on these, with the year 2019 as a pre-Covid baseline. We found that in London, (1) People are making fewer but longer trips since March 2020. (2) In 2020, travellers showed comparatively reduced interest in central and sub-central activity locations compared to those in outer areas, whereas, in 2021, there is a sign of a return to the old norm. (3) Contrary to some relevant literature on mobility and virus transmission, we found a poor spatial relationship at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level between reported COVID-19 cases and Twitter mobility.

The study is based on the qualitative analysis of verbal descriptions collected from open-ended questions included in a survey administered in January 2021 to 464 respondents living in London, during the COVID-19 lockdown. The range of impacts in the actual scenario varied from no effect on task execution, to disruption, distraction, concern of disturbing others or being heard. Positive impacts included support of concentration, relaxation, motivation, freedom of sound expression, feeling of being connected to the surroundings and comforted by the presence of others, according to mechanisms described in the study. Negative appraisal could trigger coping strategies (e.g., controlling windows, playing music, wearing headphones) and behavioural changes (e.g., lowering the volume of the voice or music, muting oneself during call, changing workout type) that could in turn limit or enhance the freedom of behaviour, affect or foster wellbeing. Negative impacts were most frequently reported on WFH (by 55% of the participants), followed by relaxation activities (40.6%), sexual activities (30.1%), and home workout (20.1%). The ideal soundscape was described as a quiet, well-sound insulated environment, which guarantees access to positive sounds (i.e., natural sounds, music, urban background), thus resulting in privacy, intimacy, and a place where to express themselves without noise-related constraints. The study complements literature findings on housing design directions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing further evidence on the impacts of poor sound insulation at home, the potential benefits of nature-based solutions for positive indoor soundscapes, and opportunities for an activity-based design of domestic environments, inclusive of a broader set of home uses and household compositions.", "partners": "1.

Using a statistical comparison of the spatial network, land use, demographic data and movement along with an assessment of historic maps, this study analysed the areas surrounding two small London rivers as well as four case studies. The study of the river corridors suggests that their urban form and function are strongly shaped by the connections with the city centre and historical land uses. At the same time, river areas are spatially segregated in comparison with their surrounding areas and they are crossed by routes that are important at city scale while local scale connections are more limited. In addition, the study found that spaces that were better utilised on riversides have a relationship with local centralities in their urban context providing more potential benefits for their communities.

UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to 1.57 \u2218C, on average and negatively by down to \u22121.21 \u2218C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future.

Currently, the number of people over 60s in London is growing rapidly and is projected to increase to approximately two million by 2035. Aims: This research aims to examine walking accessibility to General Practitioners (GPs) for older people in Greater London, with a particular focus from a temporal perspective. Methods: Three different datasets were used for this study, namely: GP services data and data on GP Opening Times data from NHS Choices; the London Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) atlas; and the road network derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study uses on the cumulative method to calculate accessibility to GPs \u2013 and applies the vertical equity index to measure temporal equity. Results: Our results show that opening times have a significant impact on accessibility to health services for older people in London. Overall accessibility peaked at midday when 15.88% of areas have a low degree of accessibility. Additionally, our study classifies local authorities into five groups based on their performance on accessibility and vertical equity measurements. We found several districts with inadequate and unequal accessibility that can be identified as vulnerable areas. Conclusions: Gaining insights into the temporal variations in accessibility to GPs represents a key step towards providing optimal services.

Yet from an urban planning and development view, natural capital may be considered a nice to have, but not essential element of urban design; taking up valuable space which could otherwise be used for traditional built environment uses. While urban natural capital is largely recognised as a positive element, its benefits are difficult to measure both in space and time, making its inclusion in urban (re)development difficult to justify. Here, using a London case study and information provided by key stakeholders, we present a system dynamics (SD) modelling framework to assess the natural capital performance of development and aid design evaluation. A headline indicator: Natural Space Performance, is used to evaluate the capacity of natural space to provide ecosystem services, providing a semi-quantitative measure of system wide impacts of change within a combined natural, built and social system. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life.

Recent models of hierarchical route planning use boundaries to plan efficiently first across regions and then within regions.

This study tested licensed London taxi drivers, who are unique in their ability to navigate London flexibly without physical navigation aids. They were asked to indicate streets they considered as boundaries for London districts or dividing areas. It was found that agreement on boundary streets varied considerably, from some boundaries providing almost no consensus to some boundaries consistently noted as boundaries. Examining the properties of the streets revealed that a key factor in the consistent boundaries was the near rectilinear nature of the designated region (e.g. Mayfair and Soho) and the distinctiveness of parks (e.g. Regent's Park). Surprisingly, the River Thames was not consistently considered as a boundary. These findings provide insight into types of environmental features that lead to the perception of explicit boundaries in large-scale urban space. Because route planning models assume that boundaries are used to segregate the space for efficient planning, these results help make predictions of the likely planning demands of different routes in such complex large-scale street networks.

This paper examines the current and future risk of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings. Continuous monitoring of outdoor and indoor temperature in bedrooms, communal areas and offices in summer 2019 helped to establish the prevalence and intensity of overheating. Dynamic thermal simulation (EnergyPlusV8.9) of the two care settings assessed the potential for avoiding active cooling in future climate using passive solutions. In both care settings, indoor temperatures were observed to exceed 30 \u00b0C during daytime hours, significantly higher than the recommended 26 \u00b0C threshold of Public Health England. Although severity of overheating was lower in the older building, overheating was found to be prevalent and prolonged across both care settings with bedroom temperatures higher than lounges especially at night. Thermal simulation analysis showed that, with regards to temperature reduction and cooling load, nighttime ventilation was the single most effective passive solution for both buildings for the current climate, while a combination of night ventilation, external shading and high-albedo external walls was the most effective package solution. By the 2080s, air-conditioning was the most effective solution for reducing temperature, but also had the highest cooling load, highlighting the importance of balancing passive with active measures to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads.", "partners": "Paul Wilkinson ", "primary_funder": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "primary_partnership_type": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Rajat Gupta\nAlastair Howard \nMike Davies \nAnna Mavrogianni \nIoanna Tsoulou \nNishesh Jain \nEleni Oikkonomou \nPaul Wilkinson "}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.305195, 51.512655], [-0.21838, 51.57676], [-0.224429, 51.493042]]}, "properties": {"name": "Hammersmith and Fulham", "full_title": "Financing urban development, three business models", "short_title": "Financing urban development", "subject_area": "Health", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of \u201cfinancialisation\u201d to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive \u201cbusiness models\u201d, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations.

In these changed social and acoustical contexts, we wanted to evaluate the perception of the indoor acoustic environment in relation to traditional and new activities performed at home, i.e., relaxation, and working from home (WFH). Taking London as a case study, the present paper presents the results of an online survey administered to 464 home workers in January 2021. The survey utilized a previously developed model for the assessment of indoor soundscapes to describe the affective responses to the acoustic environments in a perceptual space defined by comfort (i.e. how comfortable or annoying the environment was judged) and content (i.e., how saturated the environment is with events and sounds) dimensions. A mixed-method approach was adopted to reinforce result validity by triangulating data from questionnaires and spontaneous descriptions given by participants. In this first part of the study, the main objectives were: (1) evaluating differences in soundscape evaluation, in terms of comfort and content dimensions, based on the activity performed at home, (2) identifying appropriate conditions for WFH and relaxation, and (3) investigating associations between psychological well-being and indoor soundscapes. The results showed that the environments were perceived as more comfortable and slightly fuller of content when rated in relation to relaxation than for WFH, thus suggesting a stricter evaluation of the acoustic environment in the latter case. As regards the second objective, spaces that were more appropriate for relaxation had high comfort, whereas spaces appropriate for WFH resulted more private and under control, i.e. with high comfort and low content scores. Lastly, better psychological well-being was associated with more comfortable soundscapes, both for WFH (rs = 0.346, p < .0005), and relaxation (rs = 0.353, p < .0005), and with lower content while WFH (rs = \u22120.133, p = .004).

UCL traces its beginnings to 1825, when a group of radical thinkers set about establishing a secular, non-residential metropolitan university. Its first architectural expression was the grand neoclassical building constructed in 1827\u20139 to designs by William Wilkins. Only the central block, portico and dome of Wilkins\u2019s scheme were completed, yet successive wing extensions gradually formed a neoclassical quadrangle in Gower Street. A hospital was built in 1833\u20134, securing space for clinical teaching. UCL was initially denied a charter and precluded from awarding degrees, a complication that was resolved by the creation of the University of London as a separate examining body in 1836. Over the next century, UCL and its hospital expanded in a gradual and piecemeal manner in line with advances in education, technology and healthcare. UCL\u2019s estate became increasingly complex, with a mixture of purpose-built blocks and the adaptation of buildings in the vicinity. A wealth of archival records, along with documentary sources and field investigation, has been used to examine the historic core of UCL\u2019s estate in Bloomsbury. Institutional identity and aspirations are analysed in concert with practical influences on building projects, such as finances and functionality. The matter of identity also arises in the attribution of buildings to specific architects, which points to a tradition of enlisting professors such as Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Thomas Hayter Lewis, Thomas Roger Smith, Frederick Moore Simpson and Albert Richardson. In practice, their work was informed by multiple voices such as committee members, academic staff, external consultants and benefactors.

However, current transit resilience research only focuses on infrastructure resilience, giving little consideration to its interaction with passengers. Moreover, even for transit infrastructure resilience, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing resilience to reflect its scale-sensitive attributes. Therefore, to make cities and transit systems move from a vulnerable state to a more resilient one, this thesis seeks to advance our understanding of transit resilience performance from macro, meso and micro levels, focusing on the interactions between infrastructure and passengers. Additionally, this research is motivated by the need to bridge the theoretical gap between the transport network and complex network science disciplines. This research draws on a multiple-level framework to investigate stations' roles in maintaining London transit resilience at macro, meso and micro levels from a network perspective. At macro level, this research examines the overall transit resilience performance by using percolation modelling and fault tolerance. At meso level, resilience as a sub-network feature is examined by unravelling the travel structure and identifying the stations' roles in maintaining resilience within and beyond metropolitan levels through community detection and Z-P scores. This research evaluates each station\u2019s role in maintaining resilience based on resilience and criticality matrix at micro level. In addition, this research seeks to answer for whom we should build resilience by including the transport equity analysis. In line with the conceptual framework, this research develops an R package1, ResilienceNet, which provides a reproducible and accessible tool to examine transit resilience at multiple levels. Three research findings can be derived from this research. First, the London transit is resilient against random disruption but relatively vulnerable to centrality-based attacks. The conventional network approach would understate or overstate the resilience performance at the macro level. Second, the empirical results justify the necessity to include an evaluation of resilience at the meso level, as the role of stations for ensuring resilience varies differently within and beyond sub-city communities. Third, at the micro-level, this research identifies 25 stations and some vulnerable groups, such as young and low-income groups, which are more likely to be affected by transit disruptions and need more attention. The results derived through analysis could be used to facilitate transport and urban planning at multiple levels, thus moving cities and transit systems from a vulnerable to a more resilient state.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Nicolas Palominos\nDuncan A.

Concurrent energy efficiency improvements to housing may modify indoor exposures to heat or cold, while population aging may increase susceptibility to temperature-related mortality. We estimate heat and cold mortality and energy consumption in London for typical (non-extreme) future climates, given projected changes in population and housing. Building physics models are used to simulate summertime and wintertime indoor temperatures and space heating energy consumption of London dwellings for \u2018baseline\u2019 (2005-2014) and future (2030s, 2050s) periods using data from the English Housing Survey, historical weather data, and projected future weather data with temperatures representative of \u2018typical\u2019 years. Linking to population projections, we calculate future heat and cold attributable mortality and energy consumption with demolition, construction, and alternative scenarios of energy efficiency retrofit. At current retrofit rates, around 168-174 annual cold-related deaths per million population would typically be avoided by the 2050s, or 261-269 deaths per million under ambitious retrofit rates. Annual heat deaths would typically increase by 1 per million per year under the current retrofit rate, and 12-13 per million under ambitious rates without population adaptation to heat. During typical future summers, an estimated 38-73% of heat-related deaths can be avoided using external shutters on windows, with their effectiveness lower for hotter summers. Despite warmer winters, ambitious retrofit rates are necessary to reduce typical annual energy consumption for heating below baseline levels, assuming no improvement in heating system efficiencies. Concerns over future overheating in energy efficient housing are valid but increases in heat attributable mortality during typical and hot (but not extreme) summers are more than offset by significant reductions in cold mortality and easily mitigated using passive measures.

A new methodology to quantify streetspace allocation is introduced using a geocomputational approach that allows both the processing of high-resolution topographic data over a large geographic extent and enables replicability for other cities. The correlation between streetspace allocation metrics and street network centrality at distinct scales is investigated across different geographic areas. These variables are then examined using cluster analysis to identify a typology of streets based on streetspace allocation and centrality. The results provide the framework for a design scenario study of inner London applying shortest-path analysis under an active travel prioritisation perspective. Streetspace statistics for London confirm the predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses. Most streets display standard residential street metrics, coinciding with traditional street classification schemes. Also, this serves to demonstrate quantitatively the spatially efficient organisation of the London street system with few wider distributors and many narrower local streets. In addition, through the combined examination of the streets' allocation and configurational metrics, it is possible to identify a new sub-type of local streets. The spatial arrangement of the streets segments types follows a centre-periphery pattern: wider and higher centrality streets are clustered at the city centre and show relative larger streetspace designated to pedestrians, corresponding with higher levels of estimated activity. On a prescriptive streetspace model of Inner London, the streetspace allocation of critical pathways is modified to illustrate how strategic scale street properties affect and are affected by design scale street parameters.

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time\u2013activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.", "partners": "Sani Dimitroulopoulou Environmental Hazards and Emergencies Department, Public Health England United Kingdom", "primary_funder": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "primary_partnership_type": "Co-authorship with government partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Lauren Ferguson \nJonathon Taylor\nKe Zhou \nClive Shrubsole\nPhil Symonds\nMike Davies\nSani Dimitroulopoulou"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.127833, 51.507265], [-0.2253, 51.5307]]}, "properties": {"name": "Care home VI, London NW10", "full_title": "Examining the magnitude and perception of summertime overheating in London care homes", "short_title": "The summertime overheating in care homes", "subject_area": "Health", "department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "abstract": "This paper brings together objective and subjective data on indoor temperature and thermal comfort to examine the magnitude and perception of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings.

The paper provides an international review of market growth in this sector together with insight into key topics associated with its freight delivery operations in urban areas. Using a substantial database of meal deliveries made in London by a major platform provider, this paper quantifies the operational performance of these deliveries and their transport and environmental impacts. On average, 9.6 deliveries were undertaken by a DD daily, with each taking 25 min from pickup to delivery with an average trip length, from restaurant to customer of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) a DD travelling 41.3 km (25.7 miles) in total per day, The analysis of the case study indicates the relative transport inefficiency of these on-demand meal deliveries compared to other forms of urban road freight (with a meal delivered by car being responsible for approximately 1300 times the distance travelled by an articulated HGV operation per tonne delivered). It also highlights the far greater GHG emissions and transport intensity associated with meals deliveries by cars and petrol mopeds compared to bicycles (emitting 5 and 11 times more GHGs per meal delivered than bicycles, respectively). The transport and GHG emissions intensity of these meal deliveries raises important policy issues, especially given therapid growth in the provision of, and demand for, these services internationally, Based on the review and analysis, the paper provides a discussion of the key issues that urban policymakers around the world need to take account of in relation to this fast-growing sector including vehicle fuel sources, road safety, trip generation rates and their impacts on local residents, together with recommended actions.", "partners": "Julian Allen \nMaja Piecyk\nMarzena Piotrowska", "primary_funder": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "primary_partnership_type": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Julian Allen\nMaja Piecyk\nTom Cherrett\nMuhammad Nabil Juhari\nFraser McLeod\nMarzena Piotrowska\nOliver Bates\nTolga Bektas\nKostas Cheliotis\nAdrian Friday\nSarah Wise"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.056905, 51.537543], [-0.08256, 51.491931]]}, "properties": {"name": "Old Kent Road", "full_title": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments", "short_title": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "", "abstract": "Despite concerns about the loss of industry, industrial land, and buildings in high-value post-industrial cities, there is concurrently a renewed enthusiasm around the potential of \u201cnew\u201d urban manufacturing and its contribution to the socio-economic diversity of cities.

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. METHODS: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007\u20132016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). RESULTS: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers.

Therefore, it is worth seeking a simple and effective approach to measure the processes of gentrification, which enables comparative studies to be conducted across different cities around the world. Using six sets of thematic data from 2001 and 2011 at the neighbourhood level, this study proposes five types of gentrification and displacement by using Chapple and Zuk\u2019s theoretical framework. London was selected as a case study. The results show that gentrification was sweeping in many ways during the 2000s in London, particularly in Inner East London. Some areas in North West London are identified as vulnerable neighbourhoods at risk of displacement and gentrification. Furthermore, it was found that most of the neighbourhoods experiencing ongoing displacement are concentrated in Outer London and Inner South London. The typology provides a useful starting point for planners and policymakers to gain deeper insights into the progress of gentrification in London.

With the spatial network approach, heritage conservation can be integrated with other planning and urban design tasks and can provide a more robust evidence for an enhanced urban conservation initiative.

This paper seeks to evaluate overheating risks in loft conversions, using integrated environmental solutions virtual environment to dynamically simulate indoor temperatures in a semi-detached dwelling in London, UK, under current and future (2050s and 2080s medium and high emissions) climate scenarios. Adaptive overheating risk and energy consumption are calculated with and without passive overheating adaptations that reduce solar gains, increase ventilation, or add thermal insulation. Marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) are then used to select the most cost-effective adaptations based on installation and ongoing energy consumption costs. Results estimate 11,340\u201312,210 more summertime Category I overheating degree-hours for the loft than conventional bedrooms in the dwelling under the current climate; total category I loft overheating degree-hours may increase to 20,319 by 2080. While external shutters and night-purge ventilation were the most effective at reducing overheating degree-hours (96% and 89%, respectively), the most cost-effective solutions considering capital and ongoing costs are ventilation strategies, including night-time purge ventilation, advance ventilation and cross ventilation. Passive adaptations are not capable of eliminating overheating entirely, and by the 2080s active cooling is likely to be required to maintain comfortable indoor conditions in lofts. Practical application: Converted lofts \u2013 present in 5.8% of English and 10.8% of London dwellings \u2013 are at significantly elevated risk of high indoor temperatures relative to conventional rooms. Passive adaptations such as ventilation and shading can effectively mitigate loft overheating until around 2080, after which active measures become necessary. When capital and ongoing costs are considered, the most cost-effective heat mitigating adaptations are night and advance ventilation and internal curtains/blinds. Heat mitigating adaptations for converted lofts should become mandatory, and such spaces should not be occupied by the vulnerable or elderly during hot weather.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Xiaoyi Li\nJonathon Taylor\nPhil Symonds"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The Association between Urban Public Transport Infrastructure and Social Equity and Spatial Accessibility within the Urban Environment", "short_title": "Urban Public Transport Infrastructure and Social Equity and Spatial Accessibility ", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "The pursuit of sustainability has been at the forefront of contemporary planning initiatives.

First, it is revealed that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, not just the areas of social deprivation previously found mainly in East London. Second, it is found that there are statistically significant differences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, such as gender, age, ethnic origin, marital status, incumbent population, employment, personal income, housing tenure, and car ownership; and also across different neighbourhoods in London. Third, the results show that functionings and capabilities differ according to an individual\u2019s socio-economic characteristics and geographical location, meaning that both the opportunities to participate in life and also the actual activities themselves differ in the case of Beijing. This is an important distinction that the Capabilities Approach (CA) offers, and it is useful to consider if the potential for achieving improved social equity is to be realised.

However, as each tool\u2019s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options.

The aim was to investigate the potential of passive and active air sampling strategies (sampling from still and actively mixed air, respectively) to explain visible mould, and understand how home/room characteristics correlate with the obtained readings. Airborne mould levels were quantified using an Andersen sampler (passively and actively), as well as by a chemical method based on the quantification of the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity (actively), which was also used to quantify surface mould. The mould levels were then correlated against physical characteristics of the tested homes/rooms, collected by means of survey sheets developed as part of this study. The findings did not reveal any independent variable governing all or most of the response variables, but a complex analysis suggested that whether it is a house or a flat could depict mould levels in the air and on the surfaces. It was also shown that a robust testing protocol should combine air and surface based methods, and an active air sampling strategy leads to a more accurate appraisal of airborne mould levels. Finally, the results showed that while there is some correlation between visible mould (and other moisture induced problems such as condensation) and measured air mould concentrations, lack of visible mould within a room does not necessarily mean low air mould concentrations, and thus one should not rely solely on visual inspection.", "partners": "Hector Altamirano \nNeil May ", "primary_funder": "Polygon UK\u00a0", "primary_partnership_type": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Hector Altamirano\nYasemin Didem Aktas\nIoanna Ioannou\nDina D'Ayala\nMelisa Canales\nMorten Reeslev"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London\u2019s nocturnal queer geographies", "short_title": "Nocturnal queer geographies", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "There are contradictory pulls in neoliberal cities.

The financial industry, left at its own devices to create and allocate money in the form of debt in line with its short-term remit of maximising stakeholder value, issues loans and allocates it towards the highest expected return-to-risk ratio. The intrinsically low risk of housing mortgages gives housing a permanent advantage in absorbing credit, if remained unregulated. This allocation, besides being undemocratic, is not in the long-term interest of economic stability and equality.

Greater London is used as the case study, with 2001 and 2011 data analysed at the level of Lower Super Output Areas, and presented using Geographic Information System and R statistical software. The findings reveal that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, adding to the previous areas of social deprivation found mainly in East London. The composite CDHA index illustrates where the most vulnerable areas are spatially. Many neighbourhoods may become less attractive for those on median or even relatively high incomes. The areas most affected may become much more expensive to live in, potentially leading to much greater pressure on travel and housing costs as people could be forced to live further from the centre of London, including beyond the Greater London boundary, which has further implications for travel.

Far from signalling a \u2018ruptural\u2019 end of neoliberal modes of urban governance, the analysis presented here shows how local authorities in London are actively articulating with, mediating, and assembling central government\u2019s radical programme of austerity. More than engendering a simple consolidation or intensification of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in a leaner register however, it is suggested that the current moment of austerity urbanism augurs a new operational matrix for local government with path changing consequences.

It argues that a post-politicising \u2018common sense\u2019 over how austerity should be rolled-out is legible across London\u2019s local authorities, based on logics of responsibilisation, contractualisation and entrepreneurialism. On the one hand, local authorities are managing demand for and divesting of services by responsibilising staff, community groups, and residents under the auspices of participatory governance whilst extending and deepening contractual arrangements with non-governmental and private providers. On the other hand, under pressure to generate new forms of revenue, local authorities are forming new real-estate special purpose vehicles to create and capture urban land and property value as rents. Whilst seeming to reproduce a condition of \u2018post-political\u2019 closure, as austerity deepens and contradictions sharpen these modes of local governance face mounting dissent from a growing part with no part. In this context, the political horizon of local government is an ambivalent one.

Contemporary research focuses on transport functions, on the economic potential of station buildings and on the potential for rail to increase catalyse redevelopment, while ignoring their role as the largest buildings in the city, creating separation within the street network. This thesis analyses eight main London railway termini in two time periods: the 1880s and the 2010s. These stations are served by different infrastructure types, from cuttings to viaducts, which form movement barriers in areas located behind them, which are also associated with social decline and post-industrial redevelopment. Space syntax analysis uncovers the impacts of railway termini and their associated structures on movement networks. The economic and social character of areas around the stations is then analysed, to identify differences between neighbourhoods in front of and behind stations. Historical data is mapped and compared with contemporary data, including land uses for both periods and social data from the Booth Poverty Survey, which is compared to contemporary income estimates. Analysis of spatial, social and economic character shows how the railway has influenced neighbourhoods located behind termini over a long period of time. The nature of this influence depends on infrastructure type, viaducts being associated with less separation than other railway structures.

The long-term sustainability of the town centre has been shown to correspond to its configurational spatial signatures. Where high streets exhibit a high ethnic diversity amongst proprietors, there appears to be a corresponding diversity of land use and goods, with a tendency to adapt and alter space for greater economic benefit. Small independent units are often further subdivided to accommodate a greater number of services and products. In the context of the local high street in the UK, the small independent Minority Ethnic Business (MEB) is a common feature, whether it is a halal butcher, an Indian chemist or a Chinese takeaway, serving both an embedded local minority community as well as often having a wider mainstream appeal. This paper seeks to examine the relationship between spatial configuration and socio-economic diversity of the local high street to investigate whether the potential for diversity is embedded in its contextual spatial characteristics. For the purpose of this study using nationally defined town centre boundaries, ten town centre case studies were selected from around London based on their residential ethnic profile and the level of deprivation of the area. Building on the literature that shows that land use diversity is associated with the persistence of smaller town centres, we test the proposition that it is also associated with the presence of MEBs. Here we tested the degree of impact of MEB presence on commercial diversity across these case studies. Additionally, the study examines the spatial and morphological signatures of these case studies and how these relate to the context of MEB presence and land use diversity, finding a strong relationship between spatial and urban form factors and a greater presence of MEBs. The study concludes that given the importance of spatial accessibility coupled with built form diversity to the presence of MEBs, greater attention needs to be given to the embedded social value in the spatial characteristics of town centres.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Laura Vaughn\nSadaf Sultan Khan\nLusine Tarkhanyan\nAshley Dhanani"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Skateboard City", "short_title": "London in Skateboarding Films", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "London has been part of the worldwide phenomenon of skateboarding, from the early 1970s right through to the present day.

Furthermore, the dynamics of pedestrian flow, generated by the new transport system might transform the social, cultural and economic activities around the stations.

To determine whether the stations integrate cohesively with the urban environment, this study applies Space Syntax methods of spatial network analysis to evaluate the spatial characteristics and compares with GIS data of the house prices and land use distribution before and after the JLE.

A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns.

On the other hand, it is argued that there are emerging clusters of ownership similarly actively managed. However, little is known yet about why property owners choose to cluster their portfolios, challenging risk diversification theories, what their active management comprises and in what institutional context they operate.

Quantitative data sources include the annual reports of property companies, which were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative methods include semi-structured interviews with cluster owners and other stakeholders, which were analysed using content analysis. Research findings suggest that property owners derive a threefold advantage from clustering and actively managing their property portfolio. First, they gain an edge over the market including new acquisitions by their detailed local knowledge and concentrated ownerships. Second, they deploy an instrumentalised form of place-making in their neighbourhood by curating the mix of uses and tenant mix, their placement, and the space in-between the buildings.

Understanding why businesses in some industries cluster is a key issue in urban economic theory, particularly in the Marshallian and Jacobsian traditions. These emphasize the logistical and informational synergies (advantages) that accrue to firms in agglomeration economies, allowing firms located near one another to accelerate their rate of innovation. However, little is known about how spatial forms foster the clustering of firms or the mechanisms through which this process might facilitate knowledge spillover over between different businesses. In this paper we present an historical case study in which space syntax methods, archival research and urban economic theory were used to enhance understanding of the spatial ordering of London's nineteenth-and early twentieth-century furniture industry, a sector characterised by a proliferation of small, local firms. The spatial morphologies of the furniture industry in the Shoreditch and Fitzrovia areas of London are profiled by linking business directories, historical Ordnance Survey maps and Goad fire insurance plans to space syntax measures describing the spatial configuration of London's street network, on a GIS platform. Historically, the two casestudy areas have hosted a wide range of furniture-manufacturing businesses. We hypothesise that the contrast between the spatial structures of the two districts contributed to the divergent paths development of the furniture industry in these places. Our results suggest the two areas developed as different knowledge economies, in part as a consequence of their contrasting spatial configurations and their influence on industrial organization. Shoreditch became a 'specialization' economy (i.e. Marshallian). Here the organic pattern of streets allowed specialized businesses to be located in close proximity to key streets, benefiting from more local footfall, and in close localization of firms belonging to the same industry. Fitzrovia, however, showed a more 'diversified' economy (i.e. Jacobsian), accommodating most of its retailers on streets highly integrated across scales and more commercially-driven. In the context of constraints of land use and rising land values, manufacturing operations moved to other places whilst retaining large-size firms that created a retail destination in a high footfall location good for attracting passing trade.

It is also experienced daily by workers and other citizens driving vehicles, serving in shops, caring for each other, cleaning, starting businesses and struggling to succeed or even survive. The city\u2019s economy generates immense wealth but also alarming levels of in-work poverty. Official accounts of the economy tend to emphasise high-productivity sectors, increasingly concentrated in office blocks in the centre, while half the activity is distributed through the city and made up of small enterprises and interlocking sub-contractors. The pressure on these activities is increasingly intense because of the inflated prices which land commands if shifted into use for housing development. Thus there has been a great deal of displacement in recent decades and there is growing controversy about how much workspace London can afford to lose. Furthermore the economy faces two major uncertainties in the next few years: the revision of business rates which threatens many enterprises and the consequences of Brexit, via changes in the terms of trade, inflation and curbs on labour mobility. Researchers at UCL\u2019s Bartlett School have just published the report on a small research project evaluating the various ways in which the diverse economies of London are understood, studied and planned for. Principal findings of the research are that Top-down studies of the London economy fail to connect with the growing number of Borough-level and bottom-up studies of economic activity in localities. This seriously weakens policy-making. Community groups and local business networks often have a strong understanding of the inter-connections between activities but these tend not to be assimilated into policy studies. Some standardisation of methodologies used in local studies would help to build a strategic picture and would generate the kind of local audits which need to preceed and inform policy decisions. Statisticians, planners and economists need to give more thought to some of the key concepts and categories which are used or needed in the analysis and understanding of local economies at various scales. There is great potential for productive discussion among statisticians, planners and economists at the various levels of government, resident and business communities in localities, and researchers. A shared repository of studies is needed so that best practice can more easily be shared and to avoid each study reinventing the wheel.

Images and texts were produced and consumed with an urge and at a speed never seen before.

A transition to more environmentally sustainable travel has proved difficult to achieve, particularly in suburban areas. For individuals in society there are many different aspirations for, and constraints on, travelling in an environmentally sustainable manner. Lack of modal choice, route options, the cost of using public transport, and wider cultural norms are a few of the barriers to realizing a more sustainable transport network. Compounding this is the 'last mile' problem, concerning the facilities linking the main mode to the home, workplace or wider destination, which are often poor. This paper explores both the perceptions and opinions of everyday commuters in Ealing, London, including consideration of their localized lastmile issues. An in-depth study is undertaken with thirty-five employees of Ealing Council, using Q methodology to investigate the participants' perceptions towards, and awareness of, their respective journeys. The Q method analysis undertaken highlighted four major discourses associated with travel and the last mile problem in Ealing: 'the public transport user', 'the committed cyclist', 'the multi-modal traveller' and 'the frustrated traveller'. Understanding these different discourses and their unique characteristics has significant potential for assisting policy-makers and planners in developing more targeted investment priorities, policies, and stakeholder engagement strategies.", "partners": "Ealing Council", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "Public Engagement ", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Robin Hickman\nGiacomo Vecia"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London Hybrid Exposure Model", "short_title": "London Hybrid Exposure Model", "subject_area": "Sustainability ", "department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "abstract": "Here we describe the development of the London Hybrid Exposure Model (LHEM), which calculates exposure of the Greater London population to outdoor air pollution sources, in-buildings, in-vehicles, and outdoors, using survey data of when and where people spend their time.

In 2011, the mean annual LHEM exposure to outdoor sources was estimated to be 37% lower for PM2.5 and 63% lower for NO2 than at the residential address. These decreased estimates reflect the effects of reduced exposure indoors, the amount of time spent indoors (\u223c95%), and the mode and duration of travel in London. We find that an individual\u2019s exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 outside their residential address is highly correlated (Pearson\u2019s R of 0.9). In contrast, LHEM exposure estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 suggest that the degree of correlation is influenced by their exposure in different transport modes.

It seeks to identify the spatial conditions that, at multiple scales, mediate and support the operation of digital industries in inner-city locations. Drawing on \u2018productionist\u2019 approaches, which examine creative industries as an industry, work is conceptualized as six activities (producing, meeting, networking, learning, displaying, socializing) performed across four spatial settings: the extended workplace, workspaces, industry events, and the neighbourhood. This qualitative case study uses three data collection methods: semi-structured interviews with workers and industry actors, observations of selected settings, and secondary data. The area is an emergent cluster of digital firms known as \u2018Silicon Roundabout\u2019 and \u2018Tech City\u2019, providing a less explored but relevant case. The thesis\u2019 contribution is threefold. First, it provides an empirical account of the spatiality of digital work in Shoreditch. This reveals a network of spaces used for work (base, ancillary, and events) suggesting a reconfiguration, and extension, of the \u2018workplace\u2019 in these industries. This spatial extension is limited and associated with spatial requirements of the tasks involved; the office still plays a central role in digital production. Second, the study identifies macro and micro spatial conditions that mediate and support these work patterns across the four spatial settings and advances the conceptualization of functional, social, and symbolic aspects of these relationships, expanding the understanding of why and how place matters in the digital economy. Third, the analysis reveals that \u2018structured interaction\u2019 and micro processes of spatial segregation and exclusion are critical to support a range of work and social practices in digital production. In contrast to influential accounts that associate creative cities with diversity and tolerance, at the scale of these spatial practices, processes of selection and quest for sameness underpin the operation of these industries within urban space(s).", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Juliana Borowozyk Martins"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.078017, 51.511861]]}, "properties": {"name": "City of London", "full_title": "A material history of the City of London, 1945-1993", "short_title": "A material history of the City of London", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "Much of the current anxiety surrounding the financial system has emerged because of its perceived obscurity, scale and intangibility. The digitalisation and deregulation of the industry since the 1950s has been at the heart of this fear, giving rise to a situation whereby the more complex and rapid financial transactions become, the less visible and less easily regulated they are. Consequently the global economy is often perceived to be a black box within which immaterial capital-flows circulate, unencumbered by the inconveniences of geography or the built environment. Yet the reality of this system is far from friction free. The world of financial services is orchestrated around people and places, co-ordinated through infrastructure and architecture, and accommodated in offices and cities. While the financial transaction itself may be an immaterial act, it relies upon a set of specific material conditions to take place. This thesis is an exploration of those conditions. Through an analysis of the urban and architectural development of the City of London, London\u2019s financial district, in the post-war period, the research considers the extent to which there is a relationship between the structure of the financial system and the structure of the environment in which it operates. This thesis is the first comprehensive material investigation of a financial centre to date. Furthermore, it is the first study that can claim to have looked at the recent architectural history of the City of London in any depth. Buttressed by two episodes of destructive violence \u2013 World War II and the IRA bombings of the early 90s \u2013 which would each herald a new urban paradigm, the research charts the gradual deregulation of the UK finance industry and its manifestation in the built form, socio-spatial arrangement, and cultural milieu of the financial centre. Structured in the shape of a conceptual cross-section, the thesis is organised into four chapters that move from the urban scale of the City, through its streets, across its facades and into the micro-geography of its interiors, in the form of trading floors, offices and furniture. The aim is not to provide a descriptive inventory of buildings and streets, but rather to connect each material layer to the wider economic and regulatory developments in the global economy, thereby creating a constant dialogue between financial place and financial space.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Amy Thomas"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Variability in Regularity", "short_title": "Temporal Mobility Patterns with Smart-Card Data", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis\u00a0(51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "abstract": "To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understanding of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.", "partners": "Transport for London\n", "primary_funder": "European Research Council (ERC)", "primary_partnership_type": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Chen Zhong\nMichael Batty\nEd Manley\nJiaqiu Wang\nZijia Wang\nFeng Chen\nGerhard Schmitt"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Southbank Skateboarding, London and Urban Culture", "short_title": "Southbank Skateboarding and Urban Culture", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "Over the last two years, skateboarding space in London has been subject to considerable controversy, debate and development.

Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture.

This research conjectures that spatial network local-areas as defined by community detection methods can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets. In order to test this conjecture, the hedonic approach will be used as an empirical strategy on the case study of London. The study found spatial network local areas correspond with planned known local area boundaries and that greater house price similarity is found within spatial network local-areas than between. The study also found that spatial network local area as defined by community detection technique can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets to explain house price. The contribution of this research is it represents a proof of concept in the use of community detection techniques in the definition of spatial housing submarket. Importantly it illustrates the significance in how spatial configuration influences housing market not just in terms of accessibility (Law et al. 2013) but also in terms of housing submarket.

To work towards the concept of MaaS-London, first, the supply and the demand sides of the London transport market are analysed. There are a variety of mobility services supplied in London such as car clubs (car sharing), ride sharing, bike sharing, public transport, rail and taxi which altogether make London an ideal ground to exploit MaaS-London. The MaaS-London is an integrated platform that includes registration and package selection, intermodal journey planning, booking, smart ticketing and payment functions so that the entire chain of transport can be managed in this centralised platform. The most outstanding feature of MaaS-London is the provision of mobility packages, which consist of tailored bundles of mobility services customised to individual needs. The feasibility study indicates that the introduction of MaaS-London will benefit both the supply and the demand side. Transport operators will benefit by creating a larger market via the integrated platform. Travellers will also welcome the concept due to travel expense and time reduction, and better service experience.

The core inquiry applies a configurational analysis to the street, viewing it as a complex entity which interfaces with both buildings and the urban street network. The research is founded on the identification of two theoretical and methodological gaps in the canon of urban design: how generic building morphology properties relate to street liveability; and, how urban diversity emerges as the result of diachronic processes. The thesis looks at architecture beyond function, geometry and aesthetics, focusing on the urban street as a generator for social contact. Building on space syntax theory, it seeks to advance the concept of the \u2018virtual community\u2019, proposing that encounter and co-presence patterns are the product of both city-wide connections and local building morphology. In order to study building-street relations in terms of the virtual community the thesis has developed a series of specialised techniques to describe and analyse the synchronic and diachronic aspects of space. The thesis is innovative in integrating space syntax and Conzenian methods to better examine the micromorphology of the street interface configurationally and typologically, capturing the changing nature of built form and building use over time. This methodology is applied to the study of two contrasting urban areas: Islington, London and West Village, Manhattan. Both possess similar building morphologies that have sustained street liveability and diversity over centuries. The results show how urban change and diversity are affected by diachronic processes working with the synchronic structure of the everyday city.

It discusses how both preconceived frameworks and emergent architectural decisions and societal rules have shaped the two cities throughout their spatial histories.

Supervised and operated via its members, the components of each institution were tied together through a mode of exchange that prized face-to-face contact, reputation and trust, epitomised by the Stock Exchange motto Dictum Meum Pactum (\u2018My word is my bond\u2019). The latter was made concrete via messenger-operated payment and clearing systems, organised around the hours of trade, provoking the need for proximity between institutions and specific architectural arrangements and resulting in an urban agglomeration of banks and other institutions in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England. The advent of digital technology entailed a decline in the economic significance of pedestrian activity in the City. The shift from manual, paper operations to onscreen transactions made redundant the kinetic network of brokers and messengers that once formed the circulatory system for banking and finance. This paper considers the way in which such shifts ultimately reconfigured the nature of the street as public space and argues that, as fundamental parts of the financial transaction were removed from the City\u2019s thoroughfares, the street would no longer be an extension of the workplace, but a space of leisure.

In recent years, the focus of economic development initiatives has shifted away from supply side initiatives, such as fiscal incentives and the direct provision of premises, towards a consideration of the collective provision of infrastructure and services, in order to meet demands of businesses and workers in cities where there is already strong demand and growth. As well as this shift from supply- to demand-side initiatives, there has been a change in the political ideological approach to land and property development, away from public sector direct provision and funding, to place greater onus on the private sector to deliver development, infrastructure and services. The introduction of \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 planning policies by local authorities in London from the early 2000s is part of this shift \u2013 building on more established key worker and affordable housing policies. This paper evaluates the success of affordable workspace planning policies in thirteen mixed use schemes in London, from the perspectives of developers and workspace providers, who are responsible for delivering and managing the affordable workspace. First, it finds that the perspective of the developer, in particular whether it sees affordable workspace policy as (a) an opportunity, (b) a \u2018tool\u2019 to secure planning permission or (c) a burden, is mostly influenced by the way in which the affordable workspace emerged within the proposal. Developers\u2019 perspectives and the success of their partnerships with workspace providers are critical to the successful delivery of affordable workspace within the scheme. Second, the findings show that \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 is difficult to define and deliver, with different interpretations used by delivery partners and the ability of workspace providers to deliver affordability depends critically on their organisational model. Finally, the research shows that although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, it is not benefiting low-value manufacturers or small family-run retail and service businesses, nor is it generally benefiting start-ups. The implications of policy outcomes for economic development are considered; overall the beneficial impacts are limited. The research concludes that the predominant model of affordable workspace policy being promoted in London will fail to meet the aspirations of policy makers, with the limited success of policy further compounded by the global recession of the late-2000s.

Adopting the hegemonic political and economic theories of Neoliberalism on the general and macro level, and the more specific theories of place marketing on the micro level, this research argues that place marketing is one of the neoliberal imaginaries used to legitimate neoliberal practices, such as Olympic land acquisition. The author connects the abstract theories of Neoliberalism and the concrete theories of place marketing with Sklair\u2019s Transnational Capitalist Class (2001) theory which suggests the formation of globally mobile elites who with their highly mobile capital have become very influential in the staging of urban mega-events and mega projects. In the particular case of the Olympic Games, some of these mobile capitalists have been very active in providing official sponsorship in exchange of exclusive marketing rights to associate their brands with the Olympics. Based on reviews of major Olympic-related official documents, a news survey on national, city and local newspapers and 31 elite interviews covering official place marketers of London, local governments, regional governmental bodies, Olympic Delivery Authority, official Olympic sponsors, small business owners and NGOs, this study points out the conflict of interests between place marketers and product marketers at the junction of urban mega-events. Understanding London\u2019s top world city status and taking into account the desire to host the Olympic Games for a third time in response to fierce inter-city competition, this research indicates how place marketing is in theory a development strategy but in practice a difficult task due to the financial dilemmas and legal issues faced by neoliberalised governments. Legislations passed and contracts signed specifically for the Olympic Games have provided priorities and exclusive rights to official sponsors who are the product marketers in this case over place marketers.

However, decision-making involves the everyday life of using and navigating in the built environment to the management of urban space. This paper seeks to understand the basic notion of how pedestrian movement is related to land use choices in the built form. The hypothesis is that movement itself involves a choice; that is, a decision-making of direction and destination, of passing through or of static behaviour. The density of movement flow is seen as a result of locations that potentially become attractors that have a rich distribution of land use. How we accommodate and modulate movement is thus important in helping us understand the multiple effects of everyday use that arises from decision-making processes and its subsequent effectuation in the configuration of urban space. Therefore, two key questions are addressed: first, how the types of movement choices influence and are influenced by the spatial layout; and second, how the distribution of land uses is affected by such choices. The paper uses Space Syntax and Game theory as a combination of theoretical frameworks that study independent and interdependent decision-making processes in urban space, to answer these questions. Taking the River Thames Path as an example, the research project focuses on the unconnected section of the river walk between London Bridge and Southwark Bridge.

The first five novels each written Le Carr\u00e9 and Deighton were published in the period 1960-1970. Although both authors and these specific works have remained popular in genre spy fiction, there has been little consideration of the works in relation to each other and in their role together in situating the potential threats of the post-war period in a UK domestic setting rather than on mainland Europe. The transition of Fleming\u2019s novels into film starting with \u2018Dr No\u2019 in 1962 suggested that UK spies engaging in espionage undertook this in exotic locations which were far removed from everyday life. An examination of the fiction of Deighton and Le Carr\u00e9 suggests a different world where the locus of external danger was in the suburban midst of Surrey or Wood Green. Whilst the war was over, the British state was still actively defending itself from internal threats and external dangers. The use of specific London locations in these first ten novels \u2013 particularly in \u2018Call for the Dead\u2019, and \u2018The Spy who came in from the Cold\u2019 by Le Carr\u00e9 and \u2018The Ipcress File\u2019 and \u2018Berlin Game\u2019 by Deighton create a language of location and fear.

I draw from architectural history, feminist and queer theory as well as geographies of sexualities to interrogate the stability of domesticity. Highlighting everyday homemaking practices of more than 40 non-heterosexual households in London, I seek to complicate one overarching regime of power that dominates our cultural value system: heteronormativity \u2013 the idea that normative heterosexuality is the default sexuality to which everyone must conform or declare themselves against. The project is a response to three decades of academic research that has looked at the spatialised ways in which sexual identity unfolds in, for the most part, peripheral zones in the \u2018Western\u2019 metropolis, spaces beyond the domestic realm. This thesis takes a different architectural approach; one where through interviewing 47 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Londoners, as well as eleven domestic tradespeople that work in these homes, agency is given to small-scale domestic interventions and everyday actions. The concept of \u2018queering\u2019 is important to the framework, which, in the context of the thesis, is understood as an on-going process that LGBTQ people are engaged in through homemaking and daily living. Although some participants may not see this as a political act, I argue otherwise and suggest queering at home is a form of political activism. Through mundane domestic actions the overarching structure of heteronormativity might be challenged. I contend that queering the home unfolds in various, complex and conflicting ways. The thesis seeks to provoke both queer theory and politics, by opening up existing approaches and remits to allow room for a domestic method.

This thesis argues that the language of public participation is not used politically for describing extra-discursive realities about public participation. Instead, it is used performatively and, as such, the politics of public participation involves a struggle between actors over the institutionalisation of particular configurations of social relations around the planning process. It also argues that this struggle is strategic and directed at the achievement of certain planning outcomes, which would be more difficult if another configuration were institutionalised. Therefore, this thesis analyses the storylines of public participation as a significant category of political analysis, and investigates the strategic use of participatory storylines by the GLA planners as they struggled over competing planning agendas. This is conduced also in the context of a variety of interests of other actors that competed against that of the planners during the London Plan making process. The research contributes to an understanding of how planners conceptualise public participation in a variety of innovative ways through performative discursive actions and how they shape planning outcomes by altering existing social relations within planning processes. It also demonstrates how their discursive actions have limited influence in planning institutions with unequal authority positions and how the planning outcomes are seemingly determined by structural forces beyond their control. Social constructivist perspective that focuses on analyzing planners\u2019 personal dynamics helps to highlight the creative ways in which planners deal with and effectively manage competing knowledge, interests and agendas on public participation.

In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society. In London, migrants of foreign origin become part of an integrated communitarism on an individual basis. Concerning the contribution of peri-urban agriculture to biodiversity, evidence gathered strongly suggests that urban farmers of foreign origin do contribute to broadening biodiversity primarily in Lisbon and to a lesser extent in London.

The changing network structure of the street systems of two outer suburban areas of Greater London, Surbiton and South Norwood, are analysed from the 1880s onwards. A temporal reading of the process of urban growth in relation to the historic street network of local centres allows for a nuanced understanding of the way in which cities grow over time. Rather than conceptualising suburban growth as either a seeding of new territories in tabula rasa or a \u2018swallowing-up\u2019 of older settlements, this article argues for a measured description of the spatial, social and economic properties of urban grid intensification. This research uses digitised historical maps, historical and contemporary land-use data together with space syntax analysis in order to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in London\u2019s suburban street network from the 1880s. The analysis demonstrates that over the period of time considered there have been distinct stages in the spatial development of the city\u2019s urban fringe. The results show that as London expanded to encircle new territories, the spatial relationships of fringe areas of the city changed markedly as larger scale infrastructure was built and local development intensified, with the effect of reconfiguring the local network of the case study suburbs. However, detailed analysis of the formation of suburban town centres using space syntax also uncovers distinctive and resilient spatial morphologies which have sustained varied modes of land use over time. Drawing on the theory of the urban \u2018movement economy\u2019 and our previous research in this area, the article shows how the complex balance of change and continuity realised in the spatial morphology of the suburban high street can be explained by complex scalar mechanisms of adaptability.

The aim of this thesis was to assess the relative impact of urban warming, built form and fabric characteristics on domestic energy use and overheating risk across a major city, using London as a case study. Two housing stock models were developed: a heat demand model based on steady-state energy use calculation techniques and a multiple linear regression overheating risk meta-model of an existing dynamic thermal simulation program. Input data was derived from existing Geographic Information System databases, national housing surveys and local urban air temperature models. The heat demand model successfully reproduced the ranking of urban areas based on their actual gas consumption (R\u00b2 = 0.817) in a case study area containing 8.6% of London's dwelling stock. The heat island was found to decrease the average annual domestic heating load by 14% in these urban areas compared to a rural reference site. It was shown that the overheating meta-model can replicate the output of the thermal simulation program (R\u00b2 = 0.763). It was indicated that highly exposed dwelling types, such as top floor flats and bungalows, as well as internally insulated buildings are likely to present an indoor overheating problem during periods of hot weather.

The research demonstrates that the contemporary role of the market is multidimensional, e.g. they appear to play significant roles as managed public space but also act as an important social and economic space, particularly for marginal social groups. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that, whilst proactive planning policies do not guarantee a vibrant market, they can play a key part in protecting their permanent loss; however, equally important is the supportive management approaches taken in shaping their social survival.

Subsequently, the combination of absolute rent and differential rent is suggested as a general structure for land rents in an urban context. The dynamic mechanism of changes in land rents is explained with the concepts of emulation, differentiation and shift between groups of houses based on the structure of land rents. The process of the formation of housing submarkets has been examined for a practical preparation for empirical analysis and a theoretical basis for the subdivision of the housing market. Spatial submarkets are identified by focusing on the interactive relationship between residential spheres (a unit consisting of a centre of employment and the surrounding residential area). Sectoral submarkets are defined based on social and environmental features as well as the structural features of dwellings. For empirical analysis, three metropolitan cities were chosen: London as monocentric, Seoul as tri-centric and Los Angeles as polycentric. Empirical analysis has used commuting patterns and the contours of house prices as the criteria to identify spatial submarkets with the help of network analysis and GIS. Simple OLS regression analysis of house prices on the accessibility to centre was conducted in each identified submarket. The results were used to explore the structure of and the dynamic changes in land rents. A consistent structure of land rents was observed in each housing submarket across all three cities.

It found actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways between current material configurations and social practices for these reconfigurations. Material configurations include infrastructures, urban form, fixtures, fittings, and water types. Social practices, include existing behaviours, imagined behaviours, desires, and aspirations. This is an important question to answer because there are many places around the world, both in developed and developing countries that currently face inadequate water supplies to serve the needs of their ever growing populations, or conversely flooding due to extreme precipitation or sea level rise. The lower Lea river basin in London is one such area. The large scale engineering solutions of pipes and pumps to control water that have been the typical solution are reaching their limits therefore it is imperative to find other means to manage water in urban environments. This research used an actor-network theory co-evolution framework to understand the existing urban water-cycle, and to find areas of transformation in order to develop actor-network co-evolutionary pathways for change. Interviews, group discussions and water diaries were used to investigate the existing conditions and anticipated future changes of both private citizens and water professionals. An iterative process of design synthesis and discussions were repeated twice to test and define the actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways. This research stretches actor-network theory from its ethnographic beginnings into the realm of the future through design propositions. It found that there were two strongly favoured actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways for reconfiguring the urban water-cycle in the lower Lea river basin.

In London, planning authorities are developing policies based on the affordable housing model that require developers of mixed-use schemes on land previously in employment use, to include an amount of \u2018affordable workspace\u2019. This research examines policy objectives and outcomes of thirteen mixed-use schemes with affordable workspace across London, with a particular focus on the London Borough of Hackney, which has been using planning gain to implement affordable workspace since 2003. The perspectives of the three main stakeholders are considered; the planning authority, the developer and the workspace provider. The research reveals that the motivations for affordable workspace policies are more about promoting economic development \u2013 in particular either protecting or promoting creative industry clusters \u2013 than promoting social equity or sustainability. To ascertain whether policy is addressing the problem, the case studies explore the factors influencing the success of schemes, the difficulty of defining and delivering \u2018affordability\u2019, whether the causes of the problem are being tackled, and who are the winners and losers. The impact of policy on economic development, city vibrancy, social equity and sustainability is analysed. The policy\u2019s contribution to job creation, cluster formation and economic diversity is explored with reference to local and regional objectives. The research shows that, although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, there are problems of industrial gentrification, the plight of lower-value businesses, and homogenous developments that contribute little to the economic or social diversity of the area.

Contemporary world cities are characterised by high levels of economic specialisation between intra-urban centres, an expanding regional scope, and market-led processes of development. These issues have been given relatively little attention in sustainable travel research, yet are increasingly defining urban structures, and need to be much better understood if improvements to urban transport sustainability are to be achieved. London has been argued to be the core of a polycentric urban region, and currently there is mixed evidence on the various sustainability and efficiency merits of more decentralised urban forms. The focus of this research is to develop analytical tools to investigate the links between urban economic geography and transportation sustainability; and apply these tools to the case study of the London region. An innovative methodology for the detailed spatial analysis of urban form, employment geography and transport sustainability is developed for this research, with a series of new application of GIS and spatial data to urban studies. Firstly an intra-metropolitan scale of spatial analysis is pursued, allowing both an extensive regional scope and a sufficiently intensive local level of detail to analyse the decentralisation processes described above. Secondly a series of detailed spatial datasets are introduced to analyse employment geography and dynamics, including business survey data and fine-scale real-estate data. For the measurement of accessibility, detailed network analysis and congestion data is used. Finally for the assessment of transportation sustainability, an indicator of CO2 emissions at intra-urban scales is developed, and is calculated for the 6.5 million journey-to-work trips in the study region. The results highlight extreme intra-urban variation in accessibility, employment geography and travel carbon emissions with clear relevance to urban form and sustainable travel debates in the London region.", "partners": "1.

The following research sets out problems associated with the traditional staged approach to development and conceptualisations of building sustainability as an output. It proposes instead a network approach as a conceptual framework for understanding processes of socio-techno network engagements with the sustainability agenda. To this end, three research questions are presented: one empirical, one analytical and one conceptual, each of which focuses on the application of a network approach to the study of urban development and the uptake of the sustainability agenda.

The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure.Methods: Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with high or very high exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure.Results: Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a high or very high risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between high or very high exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to no exposure likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for number of residents and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern.Conclusion: This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit.

The thesis considers some issues associated with the use of motorcycles that help inform policy and strategy at both the national and the local level. These include safety, emissions, noise, congestion and use of the road space. These issues are then tested through case studies of policies and strategies produced by two the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Harrow. The final section compares the characteristics of motorcycles against the requirements of a sustainable transport system and summarises the positive and negative contributions that motorcycles can make. This thesis attempts to answer the questions: Do motorcycles represent a more sustainable transport mode than the private car in Greater London Could an increase in motorcycle use, at the expense of either car or public transport use, have a significant impact on the sustainability of transport in London Would encouraging motorcycle use present a more sustainable approach to London overall, in terms of secondary environmental measures What role can land-use planning have in assisting motorcycle use The thesis concludes that motorcycles do have a role to play in helping to achieve a more sustainable transport system in London, but this is to some extent, dependent on the type and location of journey the vehicle is used for.

Furthermore, through the application of the latest segment angular techniques, space syntax analysis reveals a new finding relating to the formation of poverty areas, which combine low integration with large numbers of small street blocks, suggesting that this combination of spatial factorshelps explain the persistence of poverty and poor quality housing, detrimental to the living standards of the poverty classes.

The paperconcludes with the proposition that when such areas are located close to economically active, well integrated streets, such spatial patterning can serve as a necessary mechanism for the social integration of minorities and is frequently part of a natural process of acculturation and integration in the urban environment.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Laura Vaughan"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Should major redevelopment in London town centres be more regionally orchestrated or locally led?", "short_title": "London town centres redevelopment: regionally orchestrated or locally led?", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "This study examines planning decision making in the provision of major retail development, at a time when there is a move towards increased regional level planning.

In London, it is beginning to shape estate renewal delivery practices, with the buoyant housing market utilised to deliver the cross subsidy needed to rebuild ailing social housing provision. The Mayor's London Plan is pushing for a more compact city, which along with the 50% target for all housing development to be 'affordable' is also serving to push proposed densities on estate renewal schemes higher. Related to this is the concept of mixing communities to achieve a critical mass of social change and alleviate so called negative 'area effects'. While a range of policy goals are suggested in the pursuit of such policies, the government has not been explicit in setting clear objectives against which policy delivery can be tested. This dissertation analyses current research into high density and mixed tenure development. It seeks to better understand the impacts when the two outcomes are combined in the London context. Six case studies taken from current research are analysed against the proposed Woodberry Down estate renewal scheme, one of a number of emerging redevelopment projects based on emerging delivery practices towards high density, mixed tenure communities. A range of barriers to effective implementation are identified, which could impact upon identified goals. The reality is that as pressure grows to deliver more housing and facilities, with less land and government subsidy, these barriers will be traded off each other by local politicians in the hope of achieving the best possible outcome under increasingly difficult circumstances. Key to this is the need to engender strong local leadership, public sector control, a proactive planning system and economic viability, both in terms of initial scheme costs and longer term management.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Thomas W B Bridgman"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Deficiencies in urban design policy for suburban town centres in London", "short_title": "Deficiencies in urban design policy ", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Awareness is increasing among planners and designers that the previously neglected suburbs may have an important role to play in enhancing the overall sustainability of the city-region. Urban design, applied with the aim of enhancing a sense of place, may also be particularly important in the traditionally 'placeless' suburban context. Following the 2004 Planning and Compensation Act, urban design frameworks began to emerge for suburban town centres in London. They are important and demand analysis, because they represent modern urban design in London moving beyond the city core into mixed-use suburban areas. Any analysis of this phenomenon must also include awareness of the implications of the London Plan, setting as it does the strategic planning context for all suburban design frameworks. Three differing case study design frameworks were selected for detailed investigation. In most cases, micro-scale design objectives within the study area were well-formulated. However, issues relating to their wider context often appeared problematic, notably the frameworks' relationship with neighbouring centres, enhancement of local distinctiveness, and their attitude towards environmental sustainability. With the relatively monocentric London Plan ignoring the important potential contribution of London's suburbs to city-region growth and sustainability, the regional planning context thus generated encourages the pariochiality highlighted within the case study design frameworks. A realignment of regional policy, particularly the formulation of strategic design goals, might offer suburban town centres more opportunity to contribute to London's growth and sustainability. According to case study evidence, such realignment should incorporate promotion of orbital public transport corridors, coordination of complementary or 'niche' roles for town centres enhancing any existing local sense of place, and top-down integration of environmental sustainability from regional to local level. This new strategic planning and design context might represent an achievable first stage towards a more sustainable, polycentric pattern of development for London.", "partners": "Stewart Clark of the London Borough of Bromley, \nBrian Hodge and Paul Garrett of the London Borough of Merton and \nMurray Broad of the London Borough of Redbridge.", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "Public Engagement ", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Jesse Honey"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "What if? the next London Plan were better?", "short_title": "What if? the next London Plan were better?", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "The paper presents a critique of procedures and substance in the London Plan, summarising and extending evidence the author was invited to give to the Examination in Public of the Plan.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Michael Edwards"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Individualism, egalitarianism, hierarchy and fatalism in London housing associations, 1988-2003", "short_title": "1988-2003: A study of housing management and cultural change", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "This thesis investigates management change in housing associations in London since the Housing Act of 1988. Previous work on housing management has tended to focus on the adoption of new public management principles, assuming that policy from 1988 has resulted in a cultural shift towards individualism. This study makes use of 'grid-group' cultural theory to challenge this assumption by tracking all four 'cultures' within housing association management: egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism as well as individualism. As a detailed qualitative analysis of the voluntary housing sector, it addresses a neglected field of study within public policy. London provides rich ground for analysis of cultural change in the voluntary housing sector. It has a higher concentration of housing associations than any other UK city, it is where most of the larger housing organisations originated and it is the site of the greatest development activity throughout the period. London housing associations encapsulate all the significant changes in housing management resulting from the reforms of the 1980s. Whilst the study finds evidence of individualistic philosophy, particularly amongst senior housing association managers, it also finds evidence of egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism. Egalitarianism remains as the legacy of housing associations' historical origins and organisational structures. Hierarchy results from an increasingly dominant role for a small number of large, elite organisations, which become more hierarchical as they grow. Fatalism has emerged as a prevalent ethos amongst front-line staff, reflected and reinforced by the increasingly negative experience of residents. The thesis reveals how, contrary to the expectations of the 1988 Act, an overall shift 'up-grid' towards hierarchalism and fatalism emerged as the most significant response.", "partners": "48 local participants", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Tony Manzi"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A critical examination of recent developments in public participation in urban regeneration with particular reference to Spitalfields, east London", "short_title": "Public participation in urban regeneration", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Community participation in urban regeneration has advanced significantly since the Skeffington report was published over 35 years ago.

New institutional landscapes are being formed across London and power is increasingly diffused across multiple sectors under a new multi-level network pattern of governance. The new institutional arrangements for London and the inauguration of the Greater London Authority in particular embody the contradictory New Labour modernisation agenda displaying evidence of centralism, managerialism and localism at the same time (Brooks, 1999). In London Thames Gateway the omnipresence of the central state is revealed despite the 'devolution' of power to a new citywide Mayor. This also suggests that Government is increasingly being 'hollowed-out' (Houghton and Counsell, 2004) but that central Government continues to 'steer' the course. If the last few years are anything to go by spatial planning and strategic planning projects in particular, are back in vogue. As in the post-war period London is faced with a projected population and jobs explosion, although for very different reasons. 'Big bang' strategic planning has returned with a vengeance but for London Thames Gateway the same old questions remain: delivery---how, who and where The current institutional apparatus continues to confuse and bemuse and this study is about contributing towards the task of converting paper plans and a multitude of competing urban visions into lived reality. A broader reconfiguration of the state, economy and civil society means that a more sophisticated understanding is required to get to grips with the different actors involved within networks and the relationships of these networks. In the context of institutional fragmentation London Thames Gateway is used as a 'window' into the current institutional framework to see how the New Labour modernisation agenda is working 'on the ground'. The study uses semi-structured interviews across the various governance tiers (i.e. central Government, pan-London and sub-regional levels) to analyse the internal and external working relationships of the various actors involved. The analysis suggests that for those organisations involved in London Thames Gateway there is a 'sense of a widely-held common project' (Amin and Thrift 1995) and that this is the 'institutional glue' that binds these organisations together. In this sense the study draws on anthropology by isolating typologies or generic characteristics to understand what binds (or not) these institutions together. The evidence also suggests that participation in developing an urban vision for London Thames Gateway has broadened to encompass sectors (such as the health sector) previously neglected in planning processes and this is a positive aspect of the reforms. In an analysis of the proposed Urban Development Corporation a number of positive (generic) components can be identified. However, the analysis also emphasises that the New Labour modernisation programme is likely to generate significant tensions and some of these are in evidence in London Thames Gateway. This is because the many changes and innovations that result from this programme are creating new institutional arrangements and there is evidence of competing cultures as emerging institutions bring with them a whole new set of values and rules-in-use. These new governance structures can be linked to London's position within the global economy, the 'flavour' of the new planning system and the spatial plans being produced to take account of these trends. The global economic race for economic competitiveness dictates that planners and planning must respond, whilst at the same time steering a course through social cohesion and environmental sustainability. It is argued that there is no spatial fait accompli and political institutions and civil society in London Thames Gateway are able to manoeuvre to steer these forces in a positive direction. And so, the broader of role of planners and their ability to deliver through these emerging institutional mechanisms is brought into question. In so doing we argue that this has forced them to cast aside traditional working practices and to develop new approaches to ensuring economic, environmental and social objectives are met through the prism of spatial planning.", "partners": "\nInterview a -Greater London Authority (GLA)\nInterview b \u2014Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) Interview c \u2014Mayor s Office\nInterview d -Greater London Authority (GLA)\nInterview e - Thames Gateway London Partnership (TGLP)", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "James Farrar"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The movement-image of the movement-machine", "short_title": "Deleuze, cinema and the London Underground", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "abstract": "This thesis addresses the London Underground in the light of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of cinema. The first chapter gives an overview of the aspects of Deleuze's philosophy, which are of particular interest in the context of architectural theory. The main postulates of transcendental empiricism are explained, followed by the four major concepts: space, time, image and event. The second chapter deals with Deleuze's understanding of the cinematic frame. The relationship between the frame and the content of framing is shown as possibly inherently dynamic. A description of the major points regarding the Underground corridor follows, with the explanation of the condition of the walking body and its relation to the surrounds. Finally, the notion of the cinematic frame and acts of framing are utilised for the conceptualisation of the Underground corridor, showing the notion of movement to be of crucial importance. Chapter three regards the platform event in relation to the cinematic shot, which is explained to be a matter of conversion of movement. The specificity of the Underground platform is related, and the relationship between the body and the moving object of the train explained. The conjunction between the platform and the shot is then proposed, to show that the platform stands at a point of conversion of movement, transforming body's relationship to its environment. Chapter four is the discussion of the Underground carriage, and its understanding in the light of Deleuze's conceptualisation of the cinematic close-up. The close-up is shown to represent a specific, qualitative transformation, which marks the shift of movement in the direction of expression. The concept of any-space-whatever is then related as an example of Deleuze's transformation of the close-up of the face to the object and then to a spatial figure. The specifics of the Underground carriage are related, introducing the notion of the motionless body inside a moving confinement, as well as the presentation of 'facialisation.' The third part of the chapter sees the explanation of the carriage event in the light of the close-up/affection-image, and it pays special attention to the transformation of movement into expression. Finally, Chapter Five sees the discussion of the Underground in general, and its relation to the city. Deleuze's understanding of the concept of montage is explained in particular its relationship to time and construction of continuities and wholes across ruptures. The Underground is discussed as an urban system and its relation to the city that harbours it addressed.

Given the lack of spatially disaggregated migration data that allows us to study patterns of dispersal from individual estates, in this article, we report on an attempt to use consumer-derived data (LCRs) to infer relocations at a high spatial resolution. The evidence presented suggests that around 85% of those displaced remain in London, with most remaining in borough, albeit there is evidence of an increasing number of moves out of London to the South-East and East of England.", "partners": "1.

The ENHANCE project is designed to understand the barriers for the application of 15mC principles in outer metropolitan areas and small cities and provide evidence to improve local planning decision-making.

Analysing actual travel behaviour in relation to the 15-minute city objectives to describe the degree to which different societal groups fulfil their daily travel needs by local trips in practice and to understand current barriers to meeting sustainable travel objectives.\n\n3.

The Stockholm region is growing rapidly and so, a significant housing shortage has become apparent. Housing prices and costs have been skyrocketing, with apartment prices having increased by 200% in a decade; and \u2018social renting\u2019 lists of up to two decades waiting time. The London metropolitan area has also seen a notable rise in population in recent years and this has increased prices to unprecedented levels and made it difficult for vulnerable households to access housing.\n\nBoth cities have earmarked densification of core urban areas and new housing development as solutions to this problem: in Stockholm, densification takes place within strategic nodes connected by transport corridors, forming a star shaped metropolitan structure delimited by ten green edges, while in London, a range of densification options have been deployed, from building tall to the purchase of social housing estates by private developers for new private denser residential development.\n\nUrban densification has been seen as an approach to counteract urban sprawl and deliver sustainable development via more compact cities which facilitate more efficient transportation and use of resources. This thinking has been combined with the orthodoxy of public space at human-scale or \u2018cities for people\u2019 to accommodate for the diversity of users and allow for positive social interactions in the urban environment. Both Stockholm and London have been using social sustainability and placemaking ideas to deliver denser as well as vibrant and socially viable urban environment and housing.\n\nAnecdotal evidence, however, points to the fact that in both cities the social sustainability agenda is used as a \u2018veiled declaration\u2019 for property-led development, which in turn is often connected to negative social impacts such as spatial displacement and segregation, gentrification and urban inequality. Moreover, placemaking is criticised for being aimed at \u2018place-promotion\u2019 and \u2018selling-the-city\u2019, and used by the two cities (and their developers) to increase property prices (and returns) at the cost of low income households.

The large amount of capital for infrastructure projects is tightly aligned with the fast and exponential global population growth, which, according to the United Nations, will reach 8 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Considering the high rate of budget overruns and delays in megaprojects, it is important to explore in depth the potential of innovative client models to deliver megaprojects. Considering the global infrastructure pipeline forecasted for the next decades, this research explores the formation of megaproject client organizations, which are new, dedicated, and often temporary entities created to deliver the project on behalf of the sponsor. The research is novel as it investigates three megaprojects in real time and adopts a supply chain management lens to conceptualize the formation and evolution of inter-organizational relationships. It contributes to two literatures, construction supply chain management and project delivery models, by exploring the megaproject client organization as the focal firm and its strategies to design the supply chain architecture. It builds upon previous research by exploring a different challenge to manage the supply chain in one-off settings, exploring the concurrent formation of a new entity and its supply chain strategies. Six megaprojects that at the time represented a combined investment of \u00a393.93 billion have been analyzed in the United Kingdom: High Speed 1 (\u00a36.16 billion), Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 (\u00a34.3 billion), London 2012 Olympics (\u00a38.77 billion), Crossrail (\u00a314.8 billion), Thames Tideway Tunnel (\u00a34.2 billion), and High Speed 2 (\u00a355.7 billion). The empirical data were collected through 210 semistructured interviews with senior megaproject leaders. Key research findings include: (i) the identification of the megaproject multilayer and multilevel organizational structure, identifying multiple organizational roles and responsibilities; (ii) understanding of the terminologies of owners, sponsors, clients, and operators in megaprojects, as well as the dynamics of its nonstatic and evolutionary nature throughout the project life cycle, unpacking who does what, when, how, and why; (iii) the process of the formation of temporary client organizations and the dimensions of the rationale behind the strategic decisions over time, in light of the plurality of potential integration methods between client and delivery partners; (iv) the importance of a clearly defined governance structure and recommendations to organize the inter-organizational relationships between sponsors, clients, delivery partners, and the supply chain. This research improves the understanding of the formation and evolution of megaproject client organizations, illustrating how the emerging temporary organizations design the supply chain architecture and the dynamics of the associated inter-organizational relationships. The research contributes toward a more informed, systemic strategic decision making by the client organization, impacting the inter-organizational relationships with the supply chain to improve megaproject delivery. Considering the sequential development of these projects, there is an opportunity to understand the evolution of the UK market as a client in delivering megaprojects, exploring the similarities and differences of the inter-organizational structures created over time.

A resident engagement approach will be taken throughout the project. This considers families with lived experience of overcrowding and community representatives as partners in the project, alongside service professionals and researchers. From discussions with these groups, a description and definition of overcrowding affecting households with families will be produced.

Understanding the factors that contribute to high indoor temperatures in care homes is crucial in developing strategies to avoid summertime overheating and the associated negative health impacts, which are expected to intensify as a result of climate change. The pilot project is undertaking preliminary work in five care settings in London to monitor the summertime conditions experienced by residents and staff, model future overheating risks and investigate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the risk of overheating. It will then bring together the learning from monitoring and modelling in expert workshops to explore the implications for guidelines and regulations, and the potential for scaling-up the project to a national scale. The work will be of interest to relevant stakeholders from the built environment, social care, public health and policy development.\n\nAs a result of global climate change, the UK is expected to experience hotter and drier summers and heatwaves are expected to occur with greater frequency, intensity and duration. According to recent climate change projections by the Met Office, increases in mean daily temperatures could be up to 5.4 deg. C during the summer months and 4.2 deg. C during winter by 2070 under a high emissions scenario. In 2003, 2,091 heat-related deaths were reported in the UK alone as a result of the European heatwave, meaning future temperature increases could lead to a parallel rise in heat-related mortality. The UK also currently has a rapidly growing number of old people, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035, compared with 8% in 2012. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The 2003 heatwave demonstrated that older people in care settings are at the highest risk of heat-related mortality. People aged over 65 years spend more than 80% of their time in residential environments or care settings, and people aged over 85 years more than 90%. Therefore, the indoor environment is a huge moderator of heat exposure in older populations: poor building design and the lack of effective heat management in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents. Care facilities function as both a home for residents and a workplace for staff, meaning that the people sharing those spaces can have diverging needs and preferences making overheating prevention measures difficult to enforce. Interactions between staff and residents play an important role in preventing overheating in care settings and it has previously been noted that staff are often made to prioritise warmth due to wide recognition of the detrimental effect cold weather can have on old-age health, leading to overheating risks being overlooked. Understanding factors that contribute to indoor summertime overheating in care homes is crucial in developing methods to prevent overheating and the subsequent negative health impacts.\n\nPrevious research by the applicants has indicated that care facilities are already overheating even under non-extreme summers, highlighting the need to develop timely prevention measures given the way temperatures are expected to rise in the UK over the next century. A key target for climate adaptation in care settings is to limit such risks by introducing passive cooling strategies via building design and occupant behaviour. Development of passive cooling strategies will reduce the likelihood of uptake of mechanical cooling, which would undermine government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the principal aim of the project is to undertake preliminary work to develop methods that will support a system of care provision in the UK that is adequately prepared for rising heat stress under climate change. The project will undertake pilot work in five care settings in the UK to monitor the thermal environment and conduct surveys with residents, frontline care staff and care home managers. Within these buildings, it will test novel approaches for understanding the comfort levels of the residents and relating this to the thermal environment. It will also test novel measurement techniques for assessing impact of heat on the health of the residents. Via detailed modelling work, it will then test methods to assess future overheating risks and to evaluate the effectiveness of overheating mitigation strategies. Throughout the project the work will bring together multidisciplinary research perspectives with those of care home practitioners and other stakeholders.

Exposure to risk factors such as air pollution, hot and cold weather and extreme events can cause reductions in general health and wellbeing, illness, hospitalization and even death. In the UK, an estimated 29,000 deaths are associated with particulate matter (PM) air pollution each year. In August 2003, a severe heatwave across Europe led to over 2,000 deaths in England, and 15,000 in France. It is estimated that this heatwave was responsible for up to 70,000 deaths over Europe as a whole.\n\nUrban populations are especially vulnerable to the risks from environmental hazards. For example, air pollution tends to be higher in cities, and the extra warming due to the urban heat island effect (which describes the increased temperature experienced in towns and cities compared with rural areas) leads to heat-related health impacts, including mortality. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) interacts with air pollution and can make it worse in cities, especially during heatwaves. Urban surfaces can even interact with weather systems and alter rainfall levels, leading to urban flooding from surface water runoff.\n\nRisks to health from environmental hazards in urban areas are increasing, due to the effects of climate change, increasing urbanization and ageing (more vulnerable) populations in most parts of the world. In 2010, more people across the world were classed as living in urban areas than rural areas for the first time. The UK is particularly urbanized; according to the 2011 census, 85% of people are classed as living in urban areas. The 2017 UK Government's Climate Change Risk Assessment highlights the need for more research into the health impacts of climate change, particulary for heat, and acknowledged the increased risks to health for urban populations. Climate change will exacerbate the effects of heat on health, through increases in mean temperature and more frequent and intense heatwaves. It is also likely to modify rainfall patterns, and alter concentrations of air pollutants such as ozone and PM, all of which will affect health.\n\nPolicies relating to climate change mitigation or adaptation require robust scientific evidence of the potential range of health impacts from multiple factors before implementation. Planned 'environmental change' in the form of interventions such as urban greening and building adaptation measures are designed to reduce future climate change as well as to adapt to the consequences of it. However, urban or building level interventions may also result in unintended negative health impacts such as increased air pollution, and these should be fully understood before measures are widely adopted.\n\nRelating environmental factors to population exposure requires a multi-disciplinary approach using a combination of epidemiological analysis, exposure assessment and chemistry or climate modelling. This process can be challenging, and a number of limitations may affect each stage of the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) process, including a lack of observational data, or insufficient representation of urban areas in modelling studies to assess temperature or air pollution exposure. The work proposed here will improve the representation of urban areas within regional meteorological and chemistry-climate models; investigate health impacts relating to the UHI and the impacts of the UHI on indoor temperature (where people spend the majority of their time) and the potential costs and benefits to health from a range of urban planning interventions.\n\nQuantifying existing health impacts in urban environments as well as the additional risks relating to climate change and planned environmental change will strengthen the evidence base for health impacts in the urban environment, help to inform public health, air pollution and urban planning policies, and will ultimately lead to an increase in the health of the population.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "Worktribe ", "authors": "Clare Heaviside"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London Urban Sub-Terrain Energy Recovery", "short_title": "London Urban Sub-Terrain Energy Recovery", "subject_area": "Technology and Computation ", "department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "abstract": "Currently, the generation of heat is one of the biggest users of energy and emitters of greenhouse gases in our cities.\n\nA recent study for the Greater London Authority identified waste heat as a potentially substantial source of low grade heat, if it could be harnessed and re-purposed.

This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60% reduction target in CO2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting policy packages that are in turn assembled into clusters of policy packages to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the policy packages are used to a \u2018high\u2019 level of application.

We begin by sketching how employment models based on input\u2013output and multiplier relationships are used to predict future employment aggregates by type and then we illustrate how these aggregates are distributed to small zones of an urban region in ways that make them consistent with the distribution of population and service employment allocated using spatial interaction-allocation models. In essence, the structure we are developing, which is part of an integrated assessment of resilience to extreme events, links input\u2013output analysis to the allocation of employment and population using traditional land use transportation interaction models. The framework then down scales these activities which are allocated to small zones to the physical level of the city using GIS-related models functioning at an even finer spatial scale. The crucial link in this chain is how we distribute detailed employment types generated from the input\u2013output model to small zones consistent with the way population and services are allocated using the LUTI model. To achieve this, we introduce an explicit employment forecasting model in which employment types are related to functions of floorspace that they use. These are estimated using linear regression analysis which enables future predictions of their location to be scaled in proportion to the totals generated from the input\u2013output framework. These future estimates of floorspace condition the supply side of the model, and combined with accessibility indicators, provide the heart of the employment location model.

Thrift, a proponent of non-representational theory conceptualises space as an emergent property of practice that occurs prior to conscious definitions. Hence, space is a site of open-ended possibilities, a non-discursive affordance to life in a given locale. Conversely, place is a more conscious and meaningful construction that people use to understand the space they live in. Although it is a complex construction in its own right, \u2018a constellation of processes rather than a thing\u2019 (Massey 2005, 141), place is distinguished by including social narratives and meanings. The concept of place, therefore, extends beyond non-reflexive practices and material flows, incorporating instead purposeful social action in the form of political activities, values, norms, memories, stories and histories. This interplay between spatial materialities, socialities and culture, which transforms a generic space into a culturally charged place, is conventionally known as place-making. Place-making activities occur when we make efforts to define, understand, experience, navigate, utilise, modify or regulate what is happening in and with space. Therefore, place-making activities bridge between space and place. They draw on the mundane practices that serve to extend or maintain local social networks through face-to-face interaction, in addition to more purposive efforts to build a sense of place and belonging. Place-making then, is about the production of locality:  the set of processes that communities used to build a sense of place out of space (Appadurai 1996; Feld and Baso 1996).

The project investigated five present-day temporary projects sited on vacant land in London. Conscious of the long history of creative temporary occupations, the project pushes against the ephemeral nature of interim projects of the past, strategically documenting the five case studies through interviews, film, site surveys and photographs.\nThe specific purpose of this paper is to contextualise this recent fieldwork against the wider historical background of the creative temporary uses of vacant urban space, therefore negotiating between definitions of \u2018vacant\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019. Vacant spaces have been historically associated with dereliction or abandonment, \u2018lost space\u2019 (Trancik 1986), \u2018urban voids\u2019 and \u2018cracks in the city\u2019 (Loukaitou-Sideris 1996). Against the perception of vacancy as waste and emptiness, a more positive reading has been promoted through the notion of the \u2018terrain vague\u2019 (de Sola-Morales 1995).\nAlthough the present-day case studies emerged out of a very particular political, economic and cultural context, that of the late-2000s recession, this is not the first time that temporary uses have emerged in the history of London. Some of the case studies of the research project are located on sites with legacies of use that stretch back far beyond the 20th century and such histories complicate our readings of these short-term projects. The paper is however primarily concerned with the post-war context of London, up to the present day. Using the case studies as a spur for reflection, it provides an overview of the key moments in the evolution of creative temporary projects developed in vacant spaces. The discussion\nalso highlights links between past and present projects. Setting out from the post-war reconstruction years, the paper explores the 1960s countercultural projects as well as the 1970s post-countercultural community garden movement and the urban ecology turn. It then considers the impact of an increasingly global environmental awareness in the 1980s, leading up to the 1990s regeneration boom. This broad survey is supported by specific historical examples of creative use - some of which have proved to be truly temporary whilst\nothers have managed to endure - explored through published material, interviews with initiators and archival photographic records.\nThrough this historical review the paper links London projects to wider movements worldwide, with particular references to US and Europe where a direct influence can be established. Key themes emerging that provide insights into practices and ideologies relating to \u2018emptiness\u2019 are discussed and their legacies for contemporary urban projects identified.

Much of the critical literature on neoliberal urban development and many of the policy frameworks that shape planning systems characterise the real estate and investment sectors in a relatively simplified way.

Such characterisations are becoming increasingly important as regulators in major cities such as London and Toronto are calling for the introduction of new policy technologies and techniques to try and exert greater territorial control over increasingly fluid investment flows, real estate actors and other institutions within cities.

In this chapter, I first interrogate these arguments, using qualitative evidence, before turning to the case study of a still-unfolding major infrastructure-led redevelopment, Crossrail, around Tottenham Court Road Station in central London, to highlight the more profound ways that LGBTQ+ venues are networked into processes of urbanization. In this case, in 2006, we see the first attempt by City Hall to name a threat to a venue specifically because of its negative impact on a protected minority, defined under the category of \u2018sexual orientation\u2019.

Smaller-scale venues in the vicinity, including those proactively inclusive of more marginalized LGBTQ+ people, were overlooked and closed. Often opportunistically located in precarious sites and buildings during temporary breaks in redevelopment cycles, LGBTQ+ venues of all models are vulnerable once those cycles accelerate. Under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, following a crisis of closures in 2015, and after a period of extensive activism to protect and reopen queer spaces, licensed LGBTQ+ venues have now been categorized as \u2018social and cultural infrastructure\u2019 in policy discussions.

Evidence from past heatwave periods indicates that London\u2019s Urban Heat Island effect contributes substantially to heat-related mortality rates. During a warm period in 2006, the proportion of heat deaths attributable to this effect was estimated to be 37.7% in outer London, 46.6% in inner London and 47.2% in central London, compared to a reference rural location. The relative effect of the heat island needs to be also examined in conjunction with the influence of individual building geometry, fabric and system characteristics. Epidemiological analyses of London mortality records have demonstrated that the spatial variation of heat-related mortality in London reflects background mortality rates related to population age. As such, higher levels of excess heat-related mortality occur in areas towards the outskirts of London with larger proportions of older residents. Housing features, however, cause a larger variation in temperature exposure and associated risks than the heat island intensity alone.

This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity.

However, such models have not taken into account the detailed hygric behaviour of the building stock under flooding and drying conditions which can vary significantly between property types, and can lead to prolonged damp and health problems. To address this problem, a building stock model of central London has been developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), with information on the age, structure, and height of each dwelling and assumptions about built form based on historical building standards and surveys. This paper describes a novel methodology for the development of a building stock model with the necessary information to carry out hygrothermal simulations of the penetration of water into the building envelopes of flooded homes and the subsequent drying under different environmental scenarios. It discusses how the risk of damp in flooded homes can be modelled using hygrothermal methods and supplemented with mould models.

We investigated the spatial variation in heat-related mortality risks across London due to population age, urban heat island (UHI) and building characteristics. Methods Dynamic building physics models were run for 126 different age and built form variants of buildings statistically representative of the London housing stock, outputting average maximum daily internal temperatures for a hot summer period in 2006. Internal and modelled UHI temperature estimates for the same period in London were mapped to individual dwellings in Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and deviations of building-specific indoor and outdoor temperatures from the London-average were calculated and summarised at ward level. Office of National Statistics age-specific absolute mortality data and the above-calculated UHI and indoor temperature anomalies were then used to estimate spatial variation in mortality according to an age-specific relative risk function for heat in London. Results There was appreciable variation in indoor temperatures under the modelled climate, with a mean maximum range of 2.5\u00b0C. Modelled results indicate that the largest mortality risks may lie in outer London, as the elderly population is larger there than in Central London. Top-floor flats in multiple occupancy buildings and bungalows were found to be the most at-risk dwelling types. Limitations in building stock information and occupancy scenario assumptions mean that some buildings may be worse than modelled. Conclusions These results indicate that UHI and indoor temperatures may cause an appreciable spatial variation in the risks from heat-related mortality, but that the driving factor remains population age.

It includes threedimensional information about buildings including their heights, volumes, wall areas, floor areas and the\n distribution of activities between different floors. These data are drawn from University College London Energy\n Institute\u2019s existing 3DStock model of London. Within the model information is attached on the ages of\n buildings, their materials of construction, and (in some cases) their servicing systems. Energy Performance\n Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) are also attached to premises and dwellings along\n with gas and electricity energy consumption.\n Buildings in London are responsible for over 65% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributed\n to the Greater London region in 2016. Reducing CO2 emissions that can be attributed to buildings is the key\n focus of this work in line with the GLA\u2019s ambition to dramatically reduce these overall CO2 emissions; aiming to\n make London a zero-carbon city by 2050.\n Improving the energy performance of existing buildings has to be a key strategy if the overall CO2\n emissions are to be reduced. Knowing the characteristics and current energy efficiency of the building stock is\n the first step towards reducing direct and indirect CO2 emissions from these buildings. Collecting the data is\n one challenge, but making sense of these huge quantities of data is a bigger challenge. Structuring the data can\n help here and so for this paper we present the evaluation of energy efficiency of buildings in London using\n urban density to aggregate the data. Energy efficiency is measured from both EPCs and energy consumption.\n Some of the existing measures that might influence current energy efficiency are then shown at different levels\n of urban density. Finally, in order to address the improvement of the energy efficiency we quantify the\n \u2018potential\u2019 improvements of these buildings (according to the EPC recommendations) and hence the suitability\n of different retrofit solutions, again aggregated by urban density. The results show that energy use intensity\n decreases as urban density increases; that urban density has some influence on existing efficiency measures\n and finally that most of the measures of retrofit potential change with increasing urban density.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Evans S, Godoy Shimizu D, Humphrey D, Steadman P, Ruyssevelt P, Liddiard R"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A typology of megaproject client models", "short_title": "A typology of megaproject client models", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Denicol J, Davies A"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London calling", "short_title": "World's top acousticians converge on capital for ICSV24", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Kang J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Assessing the Current and Future Risk of Overheating in London\u2019s Care Homes", "short_title": "The Current and Future Risk of Overheating in London\u2019s Care Homes", "subject_area": "", "department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "abstract": "The warming climate causes adverse effects on thermal\ncomfort and health, especially for vulnerable older\nadults.

Reducing energy demand by implementing rapid energy saving measures has been effective in mitigating many electricity shortages globally to date. This thesis investigates whether similar measures could be effective in the UK in the event of a natural gas shortage, using a case study of London\u2019s households. A mail survey was developed and sent to a sample of 1,600 households in London to investigate which energy saving actions respondents would implement in a gas shortage. The questionnaire suggested a hypothetical scenario, where the media and government asked households to save energy for one month and also included questions about the respondents, their households and their dwellings. The resulting energy savings were subsequently calculated for each household using \u2018MESAH\u2019, a computer model developed during this research. This model used energy saving estimates based on a review of literature about household activities that use energy. Using these assumptions, the savings achieved by the different households varied vastly, reaching an overall total of approximately 30% of normal gas and electricity use in January. This result was relatively stable during the winter season. It was however found to be very sensitive to assumptions taken about the energy savings, and whether the respondents implemented actions as stated in the survey. It also found that the different actions proposed had very disparate saving impacts. The savings calculated represent high estimates of energy saving potential, rather than predictions due to uncertainties and limitations in the research. The project identified rapid energy savings as an option for an emergency response, but stressed that this approach should only be taken in extreme situations", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Julien A, Croxford B, Barrett M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Residential Development and Sustainable Travel Patterns in the London Region 2011-22", "short_title": "The Widening Price Gap for Sustainable Housing", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "abstract": "London\u2019s sustainable planning aims are being affected by acute housing affordability challenges.

After accounting for geographical features, car ownership, population density, and spatial autocorrelation in spatial lag models, the disparities for ethnicity were found, as the mixed and other ethnic groups were more disadvantaged both in 2011 and 2021, while the Asian ethnic groups had a more advantaged position.

Simulations are performed with the urban surfaces represented and with the urban surfaces replaced with grass in order to calculate the urban increment on the local meteorology. The local urban effects were moderated to some extent by the passage of an onshore flow that propagated up the Thames estuary and across the city, cooling London slightly in the afternoon. Validations of screen-level temperature show encouraging agreement to within 1\u20132 K, when the urban increment is up to 5 K. The model results are then used to examine factors shaping the spatial and temporal structure of London's atmospheric boundary layer. The simulations reconcile the differences in the temporal evolution of the urban heat island (UHI) shown in various studies and demonstrate that the variation of UHI with time depends strongly on the urban fetch. The UHI at a location downwind of the city centre shows a decrease in UHI during the night, while the UHI at the city centre stays constant. Finally, the UHI at a location upwind of the city centre increases continuously. The magnitude of the UHI by the time of the evening transition increases with urban fetch. The urban increments are largest at night, when the boundary layer is shallow. The boundary layer experiences continued warming after sunset, as the heat from the urban fabric is released, and a weakly convective boundary layer develops across the city. The urban land-use fraction is the dominant control on the spatial structure in the sensible heat flux and the resulting urban increment, although even the weak advection present in this case study is sufficient to advect the peak temperature increments downwind of the most built-up areas.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "SI Bohnenstengel \nS Evans\nPA Clark \nSE Belcher"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Transport and climate change", "short_title": "Simulating the Options for Carbon Reduction in London", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Transport is a major user of carbon-based fuels, and it is increasingly being highlighted as the sector\nwhich contributes least to CO2 emission reduction targets.

By the seventeenth century, there were seven principal gates in the old wall: from east to west starting from the Tower, they were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate and Ludgate. On the bridge across the River Thames \u2013 the only point of entry to the City from the south \u2013 there were two more gates. The ditch, as John Stow recorded in his Survey of London (first published in 1598), was \u2018of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon\u2019. This treatment of the ditch points to how the urban fabric had long since pushed through the gates and beyond the old walls; this area \u2018without\u2019, but still under the City\u2019s jurisdiction, was known as the Liberties. In Hollar\u2019s map of London in the later seventeenth century (Fig. 1), the walls and gates are a clearly visible feature defining the core of the City, which none the less spreads beyond them, in particular to the west. The limits of the Liberties were marked on main roads by \u2018bars\u2019, usually consisting of posts and chains, as at Holborn (to the north) or Whitechapel (to the east). Temple Bar, however, situated on Fleet Street to the west of Ludgate, had been made a gateway by the mid-fourteenth century, a reflection of its importance as the main point of transition between the Cities of London and Westminster. As such Temple Bar was considered one of the City gates; it was the eighth gate in the engraved plate that accompanied John Strype\u2019s version of Stow\u2019s Survey, published in 1720.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Emily Mann"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012", "short_title": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "No abstract", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Mike Raco"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The London Way", "short_title": "The Politics of London\u2019s Strategic Design", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Matthew Carmona tracks the vicissitudes of London\u2019s political engagement in urban design over the last decade.

In the UK, a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme was launched in 2010 and has been so successful in creating growth in the PV market that tariff digression has had to be accelerated. A loan scheme, the Green Deal, which provides up front capital for energy efficiency measures was launched in 2012.\n\nDespite the success of the FiT scheme, the penetration of PV in London has lagged behind other areas.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, 5.1% of spending on groceries in 2013 was transacted online, an increase from 3.8% in 2010. (The level was 1.1% in 2003.) Transport researchers face serious gaps in empirical data coverage of this phenomenon, however, because regional and national travel surveys typically collect limited information with which to establish how in-store and online shopping relate to one another. To address this issue, the authors employed a well-established data resource in a novel approach. The UK Living Costs and Food Survey is traditionally used to track aggregate household expenditure patterns and to monitor price inflation. This study drew on the unique nature of the survey's expenditure diary, in which respondents recorded each item that they purchased during a 2-week period; respondents also recorded whether each shopping occasion was in-store or online. Empirically, it was found that shopping basket characteristics (types of products being purchased) were significantly linked with channel choice (online versus in-store). Furthermore, with a twostage modeling approach, it was found that sociodemographic factors appeared to relate in different ways to adoption of online shopping in general and to the choice of online versus in-store for individual shopping occasions.

In 2018, British newspaper The Times published an expos\u00e9 of the international non-governmental organisation (INGO) Oxfam GB and its handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct of its staff in Haiti and the Philippines (known colloquially as the \u201cOxfam-Haiti scandal\u201d). An investigation into Oxfam GB by the Charity Commission, a government body that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales, found that the organisation\u2019s safeguarding strategy, approach and resourcing were significant areas of weakness that meant \u201cthe charity exposed itself to undue risk, amounting to mismanagement in the administration of the charity\u201d.Footnote 1 The lever of exposure to risks \u2013 including the risk of causing harm to others alongside reputational risks \u2013 led to major sector-wide investment and the growth of teams of safeguarding professionals that introduced new or shored up existing policies, practices, lines of reporting and accountability and engendered behavioural change. By 2022, the international development and charity sector has become well versed and proactive in its management and mitigation of risks within the organisation and those caused by the organisation. These are risks that can be known, boxed into processes attentive to them and contained so that organisations may continue their substantive work. This framework and approach to understanding and managing risk as an operational exercise seems profoundly unsuited to the next great challenge facing the international development and charity sector and the development sector more widely \u2013 a challenge that aims to undo its rules and institutions and disrupt its very paradigm of knowing.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Patel K"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Investigating the Implications of the London Heathrow Airport Expansion for the Landside Freight Industry", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Lee R, Shammut M, Allen J, Gao X, Yang T, Cao M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Changes in life expectancy and house prices in London from 2002 to 2019", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Bennett JE, Rashid T, Zolfaghari A, Doyle Y, Suel E, Pearson-Stuttard J, Davies B, Fecht D, Muller ES, Nathvani RS, Sportiche N, Daby HI, Johnson E, Li G, Flaxman S, Toledano MB, Asaria M, Ezzati M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "An open-source automatic survey of green roofs in London using segmentation of aerial imagery", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Simpson CH, Brousse O, Mohajeri N, Davies M, Heaviside C"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A Community-based Whole Life Carbon Assessment", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Nava S, Chalabi Z, Bell S, Burman E"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Analysis of inequalities in personal exposure to PM2.5", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Ferguson L, Taylor J, Symonds P, Davies M, Dimitroulopoulou S"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Shrinking homes?

In Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, safety is one of the foundational needs of well-being. The built environment should be safe to use at all times of the day and for all groups of people. After dark, the appearance of the outdoor environment changes dramatically, and this could impact the opportunities for crime. This study investigated the impact of daylight on the rates of different types of crime by comparing the crime rates during selected periods of daylight and darkness. The study used records of crime data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By studying crimes in the week on either side of the twice-yearly clock change, it is possible to compare periods that are dark in one week and light in the other at the same clock time. Where the time at which the crime took place was known, and using the GPS coordinates of the specific crime, the solar altitude was calculated and used to determine if it was light or dark at the time of the crime. A similar calculation was used to see if the crime would have been in the dark or light in the week on the other side of the clock change. The headline result is that there was 4.8% (OR 1.07) more crime in the dark periods than the light ones. However, this increase was not uniform across all crime types, and there were some further complications in some results due to potential changes in the behavior of some victims after dark. For the crimes of theft from a person and robbery of personal property, there was a significant increase during the dark period. The availability of light had an impact on the rate of certain crimes. Whilst this does not provide any information about the impact of street lighting on crime, it does provide some idea of by how much crime could be reduced if better lighting was provided.",

technology use in neighbourhood life tend to foreground either media or space and treat the other as a backdrop. As a result, there is much research on the way neighbourhoods become the content of media and how media could be instrumentalised to improve local communities, but there is a lack of synthesis of media and built environment research allowing a nuanced understanding of the role of communication technology in neighbourhood life. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a richer set of interlinked concepts and methods than that which is currently available to describe urban communications. Existing theoretical frameworks are expanded upon through critical development of a number of approaches to \u2018placing\u2019 the main hyperlocal news blog for one neighbourhood: mapping the locations it discusses; analysing the geographical and network characteristics of its social media network; and the development of grounded theory about the use of media in the neighbourhood through qualitative interviews.\nThe main arguments hold that even at the hyperlocal scale, theories of the national public sphere can help understand the way that imaginaries of place are formed through media; that a focus on subjective imaginaries and non-instrumental storytelling enables a better description of hyperlocal media use than on its instrumental value; and that neighbourhoods should be described as communication ecologies formed of multi-modal actor-networks of people, places, and technologies, rather than as separate spatial and virtual realities. The findings are largely methodological, demonstrating the possibility of placing media by mapping the issues it frames; of illustrating links between spatial morphology and the distribution of issues and social media networks; of using qualitative data to spatialize theories of the formation of the public sphere; and a proposition for a new method for building a socio-technical interaction network demonstrating the structure of the hyperlocal communication ecology.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Bingham-Hall J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Sustainability as the success of a centre over time", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "29-31 August 2007\n\nAbstract\nThis paper argues that the concept of \u2018sustainability\u2019 is best approached in terms of the factors favourable to the persistence of socio-economic activity in a given centre over time. It suggests that the question of how some places are able to\u2018re-invent\u2019 themselves over successive historical periods lies at the heart of what sustainability actually means.\n\nThe absence of a strong definition of sustainability, often misinterpreted as an exclusively environmental term, has impeded proper understanding of the temporality it strongly implies. This is particularly true in the field of urban design where the relation of the built environment to socio-economic change is poorly theorised and rarely integrated into methodology.\n\nThis issue is addressed in this paper by drawing on preliminary research conducted by the EPRSC\u2019s Successful Suburban Town Centres project which runs for three years at UCL. A critical examination of the literature of sustainability and an evaluation of relevant time-series datasets provided the basis for an heuristic methodology able to distinguish a wide range of \u2018successful\u2019 suburban town centres. The methodology comprises a series of filters and sorting criteria employing socio-economic, geographical, historical and morphological data, backed up with fieldwork where necessary and integrated into a GIS.\n\nThe selection process produced a sample of suburban centres all of which may be considered to be \u2018successful\u2019 in the sense that they continue to function effectively despite histories of socio-economic change and physical transformation. The explanation for this appears to lie in their distinctive combinations of socio-economic diversity and morphological robustness. For this reason it is asserted that the long-term \u2018success\u2019 of these suburban centres should be considered as a prerequisite rather than an outcome of \u2018sustainability\u2019 which is too abstract a term to sufficiently articulate the particularities of place.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Griffiths S, Vaughan L, Haklay M, Sahbaz O"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Some Theoretical and Methodological Implications of Space Syntax Methodology for Historical GIS", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Griffiths S, Jones CE, Haklay M, Vaughan L"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A morphological approach to the persistence of socio-economic activity in three suburbs of Greater London.", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "4 -

This research enhances standard walkability models with fieldwork that actively engages with the community to understand the factors that shape everyday mobility and walking behaviours. Amongst several factors, public transport accessibility was added as a spatial variable that contributes to walkability, whilst walkable land uses were selected to be appropriate to the specific (UK) context.\n \nThe model also incorporates an advanced method to evaluate the spatial structure of the street network instead of the standard approach of measuring intersection density. Here, space syntax network analysis methods are used, that examine the spatial relationship across the street network at a range of scales by looking at the geometric relationships between spaces. This method more closely accounts for spatial cognition and human wayfinding principles in the way that it uses the actual pedestrian routes taken through the urban environment as the basis for the evaluation of the street network. This method of assessing street network properties holds the potential for improving both walkability studies, and associated health research. It also aims to increase the awareness of the planning profession of the importance of the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the built environment in shaping walking behaviours, and enabling populations to live healthier lives through higher levels of active transport and physical activity.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Dhanani AN, Vaughan L, Boniface S, Anciaes P, Scholes S, Mindell J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Tall building management in London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Short MJ"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Community severance from major roads", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Mindell JS, Jones P, Haklay M, Scholes S, Groce N, Vaughan L"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "At home with LGBTQ Londoners", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Subverting domesticity", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Architectural history meets queer theory", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London as art industry cluster", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Son JW"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Restoring street connectivity across the Great West Road in Hounslow, London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Anciaes P"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Determinants of Satisfaction, Loyalty and Landlord Advocacy amongst Private Rented Sector Tenants at East Village, London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "Over the past five years, the private rented sector has become a significant asset class for institutional investors in the UK. One of the main determinants of returns from residential investment property is the income obtained from tenants\u2019 rent. Income return is affected by several factors, including residents\u2019 satisfaction and their loyalty (in renewing their lease). The ease with which a landlord can let vacant property also depends upon their reputation, the desirability of the neighbourhood, the rental terms and the properties themselves.\nThis paper analyses almost 5000 interviews with PRS tenants in the UK, conducted over a four-year period, to investigate determinants of resident satisfaction, loyalty (lease renewal) and willingness to recommend their landlord. Statistical analysis is performed using respondents\u2019 ratings of satisfaction with many aspects of their occupancy as explanatory variables. Comparisons are made between interviewees who renew their lease and those who do not renew.  \nThe research finds that \u201cease of doing business\u201d with their landlord is a strong predictor of residents\u2019 satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Other key indicators for lease renewal include relationship management, rent collection and value for money. Tenants\u2019 willingness to recommend their landlord depends mainly on their relationship with their landlord, how the landlord compares with tenants\u2019 previous landlords, and the property management service they receive.\nThis research should help to improve the landlord \u2013 tenant relationship in the Private Rented Sector", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "",
