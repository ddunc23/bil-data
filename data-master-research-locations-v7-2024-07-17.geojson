Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006\u20132016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits.

Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010\u20132050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV.

They found that from 1786 to 1920 the city was multifractal, that is, it had a heterogeneous distribution of street intersections with just as many areas having a lot as having only a few. After 1920, the network gradually lost its multifractality, and by 2010 it had become nearly monofractal with a homogeneous distribution dominated by regions with multiple intersections.

This led to the network only being able to expand by filling in the space delimited by the belt.

Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node- place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification- diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node-place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension \u2013 design \u2013 into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment.

Through an inductive theory building approach drawing upon semi-structured interviews with client-side project leadership, internal documents, publicly available data and ongoing engagement with the field, we identified three key capability-enabling mechanisms that help explain the genesis of project capabilities in inter-organisational settings: (1) reconfiguring project capabilities, (2) adapting project capabilities and (3) maintaining project capabilities. We discuss and expand these findings by engaging with theoretical ideas from project studies, and mainstream strategy, organisation, and management research to induce a dynamic model that can be helpful to guide future research, policy and management practices relating to the client side management of project capabilities.", "partners": "Phil Wilbraham|Sally Blackwell ", "funders": "Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "partnership_types": "Research support", "data_source": "REF 2021", "authors": "Vedran Zerjav|Andrew Edkins|Andrew Davies"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.089, 51.513347]]}, "properties": {"name": "Bank Underground Station", "full_title": "Re-Creating Organizational Routines to Transition Through the Project Life Cycle", "short_title": "Re-Creating Organizational Routines to Transition Through the Project Life Cycle", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Construction and Engineering", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction", "abstract": "This article provides new insights into the project life cycle by proposing an alternative image to the predefined time boundary between life cycle stages.

This process of financialisation, it is claimed, is driven by the needs of developers and investors, who are focused on maximising returns and limiting their social and economic liabilities. Planning agencies and traditional territory-based arrangements are viewed with increasing suspicion, as standing in the way of investment and acting as a brake on much needed house-building and regeneration. However, in this paper, drawing on detailed research with investors and developers in London, we argue that there needs to be a stronger focus in academic and policy writing on the multiple, variegated, and diverse calculations and framings that private sector actors take when making investment decisions. Too often their perspectives are caricatured and/or over-simplified. We show that perspectives and imaginations of planning and regulation are more complex and that many firms have realised that market success results from becoming more deeply embedded in the local political, social, and regulatory environments in which they are investing. A greater understanding of these multiple forms of calculation, in turn, opens up opportunities for the maintenance and/or implementation of more effective forms of territorially-based soft and hard regulation.

In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demon- strate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning \u2013 being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features.

It uses the example of diversity planning to examine the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of urban politics.

The present study takes a step further by (1) investigating the positive and negative impacts of the \u201cactual\u201d acoustic environment on a range of activities, i.e., WFH, relaxation, physical, and sexual activities, and (2) identifying the characteristics of an \u201cideal\u201d indoor soundscape. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of verbal descriptions collected from open-ended questions included in a survey administered in January 2021 to 464 respondents living in London, during the COVID-19 lockdown. The range of impacts in the actual scenario varied from no effect on task execution, to disruption, distraction, concern of disturbing others or being heard. Positive impacts included support of concentration, relaxation, motivation, freedom of sound expression, feeling of being connected to the surroundings and comforted by the presence of others, according to mechanisms described in the study. Negative appraisal could trigger coping strategies (e.g., controlling windows, playing music, wearing headphones) and behavioural changes (e.g., lowering the volume of the voice or music, muting oneself during call, changing workout type) that could in turn limit or enhance the freedom of behaviour, affect or foster wellbeing. Negative impacts were most frequently reported on WFH (by 55% of the participants), followed by relaxation activities (40.6%), sexual activities (30.1%), and home workout (20.1%). The ideal soundscape was described as a quiet, well-sound insulated environment, which guarantees access to positive sounds (i.e., natural sounds, music, urban background), thus resulting in privacy, intimacy, and a place where to express themselves without noise-related constraints. The study complements literature findings on housing design directions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing further evidence on the impacts of poor sound insulation at home, the potential benefits of nature-based solutions for positive indoor soundscapes, and opportunities for an activity-based design of domestic environments, inclusive of a broader set of home uses and household compositions.", "partners": "1.

Multisource data from national health services and the London Geomni map were processed with GIS techniques and statistically analysed.

The Amsterdam and London analysis results show different examples in terms of street interconnections with canals in the formation of urban structures. While the urban form has been shaped with a top-down planning process in the form of a regular grid structure designed with canals in Amsterdam, the urban form of London is a dominant landbased spatial structure with regard to its movement potentials.

Using a statistical comparison of the spatial network, land use, demographic data and movement along with an assessment of historic maps, this study analysed the areas surrounding two small London rivers as well as four case studies. The study of the river corridors suggests that their urban form and function are strongly shaped by the connections with the city centre and historical land uses. At the same time, river areas are spatially segregated in comparison with their surrounding areas and they are crossed by routes that are important at city scale while local scale connections are more limited. In addition, the study found that spaces that were better utilised on riversides have a relationship with local centralities in their urban context providing more potential benefits for their communities. A better understanding of the characteristics of river areas and their relationship with the urban environment, particularly the level of accessibility of these natural areas, is relevant to improve policymaking and design interventions that can foster a better relationship between natural resources and the city.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Cristin Vanegas|Kayvan Karimi"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Refurbish or replace?

Currently, the number of people over 60s in London is growing rapidly and is projected to increase to approximately two million by 2035. Aims: This research aims to examine walking accessibility to General Practitioners (GPs) for older people in Greater London, with a particular focus from a temporal perspective. Methods: Three different datasets were used for this study, namely: GP services data and data on GP Opening Times data from NHS Choices; the London Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) atlas; and the road network derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study uses on the cumulative method to calculate accessibility to GPs \u2013 and applies the vertical equity index to measure temporal equity. Results: Our results show that opening times have a significant impact on accessibility to health services for older people in London. Overall accessibility peaked at midday when 15.88% of areas have a low degree of accessibility. Additionally, our study classifies local authorities into five groups based on their performance on accessibility and vertical equity measurements. We found several districts with inadequate and unequal accessibility that can be identified as vulnerable areas. Conclusions: Gaining insights into the temporal variations in accessibility to GPs represents a key step towards providing optimal services.

We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life.

Recent models of hierarchical route planning use boundaries to plan efficiently first across regions and then within regions.

This study tested licensed London taxi drivers, who are unique in their ability to navigate London flexibly without physical navigation aids. They were asked to indicate streets they considered as boundaries for London districts or dividing areas. It was found that agreement on boundary streets varied considerably, from some boundaries providing almost no consensus to some boundaries consistently noted as boundaries. Examining the properties of the streets revealed that a key factor in the consistent boundaries was the near rectilinear nature of the designated region (e.g. Mayfair and Soho) and the distinctiveness of parks (e.g. Regent's Park). Surprisingly, the River Thames was not consistently considered as a boundary. These findings provide insight into types of environmental features that lead to the perception of explicit boundaries in large-scale urban space. Because route planning models assume that boundaries are used to segregate the space for efficient planning, these results help make predictions of the likely planning demands of different routes in such complex large-scale street networks.

Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation.

We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case.

Taking London as a case study, the present paper presents the results of an online survey administered to 464 home workers in January 2021. The survey utilized a previously developed model for the assessment of indoor soundscapes to describe the affective responses to the acoustic environments in a perceptual space defined by comfort (i.e. how comfortable or annoying the environment was judged) and content (i.e., how saturated the environment is with events and sounds) dimensions. A mixed-method approach was adopted to reinforce result validity by triangulating data from questionnaires and spontaneous descriptions given by participants. In this first part of the study, the main objectives were: (1) evaluating differences in soundscape evaluation, in terms of comfort and content dimensions, based on the activity performed at home, (2) identifying appropriate conditions for WFH and relaxation, and (3) investigating associations between psychological well-being and indoor soundscapes. The results showed that the environments were perceived as more comfortable and slightly fuller of content when rated in relation to relaxation than for WFH, thus suggesting a stricter evaluation of the acoustic environment in the latter case. As regards the second objective, spaces that were more appropriate for relaxation had high comfort, whereas spaces appropriate for WFH resulted more private and under control, i.e. with high comfort and low content scores. Lastly, better psychological well-being was associated with more comfortable soundscapes, both for WFH (rs = 0.346, p < .0005), and relaxation (rs = 0.353, p < .0005), and with lower content while WFH (rs = \u22120.133, p = .004).

UCL traces its beginnings to 1825, when a group of radical thinkers set about establishing a secular, non-residential metropolitan university. Its first architectural expression was the grand neoclassical building constructed in 1827\u20139 to designs by William Wilkins. Only the central block, portico and dome of Wilkins\u2019s scheme were completed, yet successive wing extensions gradually formed a neoclassical quadrangle in Gower Street. A hospital was built in 1833\u20134, securing space for clinical teaching. UCL was initially denied a charter and precluded from awarding degrees, a complication that was resolved by the creation of the University of London as a separate examining body in 1836. Over the next century, UCL and its hospital expanded in a gradual and piecemeal manner in line with advances in education, technology and healthcare. UCL\u2019s estate became increasingly complex, with a mixture of purpose-built blocks and the adaptation of buildings in the vicinity. A wealth of archival records, along with documentary sources and field investigation, has been used to examine the historic core of UCL\u2019s estate in Bloomsbury. Institutional identity and aspirations are analysed in concert with practical influences on building projects, such as finances and functionality. The matter of identity also arises in the attribution of buildings to specific architects, which points to a tradition of enlisting professors such as Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Thomas Hayter Lewis, Thomas Roger Smith, Frederick Moore Simpson and Albert Richardson. In practice, their work was informed by multiple voices such as committee members, academic staff, external consultants and benefactors.

However, current transit resilience research only focuses on infrastructure resilience, giving little consideration to its interaction with passengers. Moreover, even for transit infrastructure resilience, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing resilience to reflect its scale-sensitive attributes. Therefore, to make cities and transit systems move from a vulnerable state to a more resilient one, this thesis seeks to advance our understanding of transit resilience performance from macro, meso and micro levels, focusing on the interactions between infrastructure and passengers. Additionally, this research is motivated by the need to bridge the theoretical gap between the transport network and complex network science disciplines. This research draws on a multiple-level framework to investigate stations' roles in maintaining London transit resilience at macro, meso and micro levels from a network perspective. At macro level, this research examines the overall transit resilience performance by using percolation modelling and fault tolerance. At meso level, resilience as a sub-network feature is examined by unravelling the travel structure and identifying the stations' roles in maintaining resilience within and beyond metropolitan levels through community detection and Z-P scores. This research evaluates each station\u2019s role in maintaining resilience based on resilience and criticality matrix at micro level. In addition, this research seeks to answer for whom we should build resilience by including the transport equity analysis. In line with the conceptual framework, this research develops an R package1, ResilienceNet, which provides a reproducible and accessible tool to examine transit resilience at multiple levels. Three research findings can be derived from this research. First, the London transit is resilient against random disruption but relatively vulnerable to centrality-based attacks. The conventional network approach would understate or overstate the resilience performance at the macro level. Second, the empirical results justify the necessity to include an evaluation of resilience at the meso level, as the role of stations for ensuring resilience varies differently within and beyond sub-city communities. Third, at the micro-level, this research identifies 25 stations and some vulnerable groups, such as young and low-income groups, which are more likely to be affected by transit disruptions and need more attention. The results derived through analysis could be used to facilitate transport and urban planning at multiple levels, thus moving cities and transit systems from a vulnerable to a more resilient state.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Nicolas Palominos|Duncan A.

Concurrent energy efficiency improvements to housing may modify indoor exposures to heat or cold, while population aging may increase susceptibility to temperature-related mortality. We estimate heat and cold mortality and energy consumption in London for typical (non-extreme) future climates, given projected changes in population and housing. Building physics models are used to simulate summertime and wintertime indoor temperatures and space heating energy consumption of London dwellings for \u2018baseline\u2019 (2005-2014) and future (2030s, 2050s) periods using data from the English Housing Survey, historical weather data, and projected future weather data with temperatures representative of \u2018typical\u2019 years. Linking to population projections, we calculate future heat and cold attributable mortality and energy consumption with demolition, construction, and alternative scenarios of energy efficiency retrofit. At current retrofit rates, around 168-174 annual cold-related deaths per million population would typically be avoided by the 2050s, or 261-269 deaths per million under ambitious retrofit rates. Annual heat deaths would typically increase by 1 per million per year under the current retrofit rate, and 12-13 per million under ambitious rates without population adaptation to heat. During typical future summers, an estimated 38-73% of heat-related deaths can be avoided using external shutters on windows, with their effectiveness lower for hotter summers. Despite warmer winters, ambitious retrofit rates are necessary to reduce typical annual energy consumption for heating below baseline levels, assuming no improvement in heating system efficiencies. Concerns over future overheating in energy efficient housing are valid but increases in heat attributable mortality during typical and hot (but not extreme) summers are more than offset by significant reductions in cold mortality and easily mitigated using passive measures. More ambitious retrofit rates are critical to reduce energy consumption and offer co-benefits for reducing cold-related mortality.", "partners": "Paul Wilkinson", "funders": "Wellcome Trust", "partnership_types": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Jonathon Taylor|Phil Symonds|Clare Heaviside|Zaid Chalabi |Mike Davies |Paul Wilkinson"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Understanding the roles of rail stations", "short_title": "Understanding the roles of rail stations", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Construction and Engineering", "output_type": "research", "department": "", "abstract": "In strategic transport planning, rail stations play different roles at different scales, particularly in large cities and metropolitan regions, where movement structure shows polycentric patterns.

Our research has three results: First, London's passenger movement network can be subdivided into seven communities. The majority of stations within the same communities are geographically localised with few exceptions. Second, stations play distinct roles in handling the patterns of movement at different scales. Typically, there exists a set of stations that are significant for connecting between metropolitan communities, because the disruption of those stations will have a greater impact on overall network efficiency and affect a larger and more diverse group of passengers.

A new methodology to quantify streetspace allocation is introduced using a geocomputational approach that allows both the processing of high-resolution topographic data over a large geographic extent and enables replicability for other cities. The correlation between streetspace allocation metrics and street network centrality at distinct scales is investigated across different geographic areas. These variables are then examined using cluster analysis to identify a typology of streets based on streetspace allocation and centrality. The results provide the framework for a design scenario study of inner London applying shortest-path analysis under an active travel prioritisation perspective. Streetspace statistics for London confirm the predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses. Most streets display standard residential street metrics, coinciding with traditional street classification schemes. Also, this serves to demonstrate quantitatively the spatially efficient organisation of the London street system with few wider distributors and many narrower local streets. In addition, through the combined examination of the streets' allocation and configurational metrics, it is possible to identify a new sub-type of local streets. The spatial arrangement of the streets segments types follows a centre-periphery pattern: wider and higher centrality streets are clustered at the city centre and show relative larger streetspace designated to pedestrians, corresponding with higher levels of estimated activity. On a prescriptive streetspace model of Inner London, the streetspace allocation of critical pathways is modified to illustrate how strategic scale street properties affect and are affected by design scale street parameters.

The results indicate strong seasonal variations, driven by increased natural ventilation rates over the summer monitoring period. A combined metric for indoor and outdoor pollutants (Itot) suggests that the IAQ in the winter (Itot = 17.7) is more than twice as bad as that seen in the summer (Itot = 8.6). Formaldehyde concentrations were lower in the non-heating season, indicating increased ventilation rates more than offset increased off-gassing, in contrast to findings in other studies.

With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time\u2013activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality.

In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2% of all properties in London, and up to 7% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of \u00a390 price increase per year.

Little is currently understood about the collective transport impacts of such activity in urban centres and to what extent this poses challenges for transport policymakers. The paper provides an international review of market growth in this sector together with insight into key topics associated with its freight delivery operations in urban areas. Using a substantial database of meal deliveries made in London by a major platform provider, this paper quantifies the operational performance of these deliveries and their transport and environmental impacts. On average, 9.6 deliveries were undertaken by a DD daily, with each taking 25 min from pickup to delivery with an average trip length, from restaurant to customer of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) a DD travelling 41.3 km (25.7 miles) in total per day, The analysis of the case study indicates the relative transport inefficiency of these on-demand meal deliveries compared to other forms of urban road freight (with a meal delivered by car being responsible for approximately 1300 times the distance travelled by an articulated HGV operation per tonne delivered). It also highlights the far greater GHG emissions and transport intensity associated with meals deliveries by cars and petrol mopeds compared to bicycles (emitting 5 and 11 times more GHGs per meal delivered than bicycles, respectively). The transport and GHG emissions intensity of these meal deliveries raises important policy issues, especially given therapid growth in the provision of, and demand for, these services internationally, Based on the review and analysis, the paper provides a discussion of the key issues that urban policymakers around the world need to take account of in relation to this fast-growing sector including vehicle fuel sources, road safety, trip generation rates and their impacts on local residents, together with recommended actions.", "partners": "Julian Allen |Maja Piecyk|Marzena Piotrowska", "funders": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), The Centre for Sustainable Road Freight", "partnership_types": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s), Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Julian Allen|Maja Piecyk|Tom Cherrett|Muhammad Nabil Juhari|Fraser McLeod|Marzena Piotrowska|Oliver Bates|Tolga Bektas|Kostas Cheliotis|Adrian Friday|Sarah Wise"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.056905, 51.537543], [-0.08256, 51.491931]]}, "properties": {"name": "Old Kent Road", "full_title": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments", "short_title": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "", "abstract": "Despite concerns about the loss of industry, industrial land, and buildings in high-value post-industrial cities, there is concurrently a renewed enthusiasm around the potential of \u201cnew\u201d urban manufacturing and its contribution to the socio-economic diversity of cities.

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. METHODS: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007\u20132016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). RESULTS: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036\u20131.043 per 1 \u00b0C temperature increase).

The method was successful in identifying isolated local area but were unsuccessful in identifying local area that was less driven by the grid but more from other urban factors. This research attempts to address this problem by embedding street characteristics in community detection to define Street Character Weighted Local Area (St-W-LA). The idea is that street neighbourhoods are not only defined by the topology of the street network but also by the morphology of the built form. In particular, we adopted Spacemate Building Density Metric in defining Density-based local area for Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Space Syntax angular choice metric in defining angular-choice-based (note. for simplicity reasons we term this betweeness-based) local area for London in the UK. We compared the results of the community detection with user defined local area through visual analysis. In general, we found the weighted and the unweighted street-based local areas to be similar.

The sets of sorted photos will reflect the visit order each user has gone through. The geographical data of the arranged photos can be converted into the topological travel routes. Finally, the routes will be mapped onto the base map using the proposed method. The collected data from the Flickr platform provide a wide range of information from static content to movement flow.

This paper seeks to evaluate overheating risks in loft conversions, using integrated environmental solutions virtual environment to dynamically simulate indoor temperatures in a semi-detached dwelling in London, UK, under current and future (2050s and 2080s medium and high emissions) climate scenarios. Adaptive overheating risk and energy consumption are calculated with and without passive overheating adaptations that reduce solar gains, increase ventilation, or add thermal insulation. Marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) are then used to select the most cost-effective adaptations based on installation and ongoing energy consumption costs. Results estimate 11,340\u201312,210 more summertime Category I overheating degree-hours for the loft than conventional bedrooms in the dwelling under the current climate; total category I loft overheating degree-hours may increase to 20,319 by 2080. While external shutters and night-purge ventilation were the most effective at reducing overheating degree-hours (96% and 89%, respectively), the most cost-effective solutions considering capital and ongoing costs are ventilation strategies, including night-time purge ventilation, advance ventilation and cross ventilation. Passive adaptations are not capable of eliminating overheating entirely, and by the 2080s active cooling is likely to be required to maintain comfortable indoor conditions in lofts. Practical application: Converted lofts \u2013 present in 5.8% of English and 10.8% of London dwellings \u2013 are at significantly elevated risk of high indoor temperatures relative to conventional rooms. Passive adaptations such as ventilation and shading can effectively mitigate loft overheating until around 2080, after which active measures become necessary. When capital and ongoing costs are considered, the most cost-effective heat mitigating adaptations are night and advance ventilation and internal curtains/blinds.

Four key findings are derived from the research analysis. First, it is revealed that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, not just the areas of social deprivation previously found mainly in East London. Second, it is found that there are statistically significant differences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, such as gender, age, ethnic origin, marital status, incumbent population, employment, personal income, housing tenure, and car ownership; and also across different neighbourhoods in London. Third, the results show that functionings and capabilities differ according to an individual\u2019s socio-economic characteristics and geographical location, meaning that both the opportunities to participate in life and also the actual activities themselves differ in the case of Beijing. This is an important distinction that the Capabilities Approach (CA) offers, and it is useful to consider if the potential for achieving improved social equity is to be realised.

However, as each tool\u2019s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus influence the overheating risk assessment in flats, while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications.

Airborne mould levels were quantified using an Andersen sampler (passively and actively), as well as by a chemical method based on the quantification of the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity (actively), which was also used to quantify surface mould. The mould levels were then correlated against physical characteristics of the tested homes/rooms, collected by means of survey sheets developed as part of this study. The findings did not reveal any independent variable governing all or most of the response variables, but a complex analysis suggested that whether it is a house or a flat could depict mould levels in the air and on the surfaces. It was also shown that a robust testing protocol should combine air and surface based methods, and an active air sampling strategy leads to a more accurate appraisal of airborne mould levels.

It interwove architectural and social history in a preservation campaign that emphasised the social value of historic buildings. In 1910 the Survey was taken under the wing of the London County Council (LCC) where its purposes knitted well with the dominant Progressive party\u2019s determination to raise historical consciousness as a counter to the interests of private property. After the Second World War the LCC took the Survey back to its roots to re-engage with development and destruction. An early fruit of this was a volume devoted to Spitalfields (volume 27, 1957). Not only did this bring attention to the district\u2019s previously uncelebrated eighteenthcentury houses, but it also broadened to account for humble and recent buildings, even those of the inter-war period. In 2016 the Survey once again returned to East London, to work towards publication on Whitechapel, a place currently witnessing huge change. An innovation for the Survey is an interactive map-based website (\u2018Survey of London \u2013 histories of Whitechapel\u2019 http://surveyoflondon.org).

In the vast literature on this topic, relatively little attention has paid to the demand side, and in particular, the role of unregulated investment demand. We argue that this demand is fuelled by the mortgage market, and encouraged implicitly by government policies, as a growth model for the UK economy through housing equity withdrawal, and as a privatised pension provision strategy. The financial industry, left at its own devices to create and allocate money in the form of debt in line with its short-term remit of maximising stakeholder value, issues loans and allocates it towards the highest expected return-to-risk ratio. The intrinsically low risk of housing mortgages gives housing a permanent advantage in absorbing credit, if remained unregulated. This allocation, besides being undemocratic, is not in the long-term interest of economic stability and equality. In this paper, we present an initial model built on existing literature and statistical data that serves as a first step towards an integrated model of London\u2019s house price dynamics since 1980, with a particular focus on the role of the financial markets.

A composite car dependence and housing affordability (CDHA) index is developed, using indices of oil vulnerability related to car travel and housing affordability. Greater London is used as the case study, with 2001 and 2011 data analysed at the level of Lower Super Output Areas, and presented using Geographic Information System and R statistical software. The findings reveal that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, adding to the previous areas of social deprivation found mainly in East London. The composite CDHA index illustrates where the most vulnerable areas are spatially. Many neighbourhoods may become less attractive for those on median or even relatively high incomes. The areas most affected may become much more expensive to live in, potentially leading to much greater pressure on travel and housing costs as people could be forced to live further from the centre of London, including beyond the Greater London boundary, which has further implications for travel.

Among these \u2018solutions\u2019 can be found the early signs of the state-executed financialization of public housing in the UK with the use of speculative council-owned special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that replace existing public housing stock with mixed-tenure developments, creating ambiguous public/private tenancies that function as homes and the basis for liquid financial assets. Drawing together parallel literatures on the financialization of urban governance and housing, and combining these with original empirical research, we situate these developments in contrast to earlier modes of governance, identifying a distinct mode of entrepreneurial governance in London: financialized municipal entrepreneurialism.

Far from signalling a \u2018ruptural\u2019 end of neoliberal modes of urban governance, the analysis presented here shows how local authorities in London are actively articulating with, mediating, and assembling central government\u2019s radical programme of austerity. More than engendering a simple consolidation or intensification of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in a leaner register however, it is suggested that the current moment of austerity urbanism augurs a new operational matrix for local government with path changing consequences. Combining insights from post-foundational theory with in-depth qualitative empirical research, this thesis presents an in-depth ground-up analysis of how austerity urbanism has been \u2018policed\u2019 and \u2018politicised\u2019. It argues that a post-politicising \u2018common sense\u2019 over how austerity should be rolled-out is legible across London\u2019s local authorities, based on logics of responsibilisation, contractualisation and entrepreneurialism. On the one hand, local authorities are managing demand for and divesting of services by responsibilising staff, community groups, and residents under the auspices of participatory governance whilst extending and deepening contractual arrangements with non-governmental and private providers. On the other hand, under pressure to generate new forms of revenue, local authorities are forming new real-estate special purpose vehicles to create and capture urban land and property value as rents. Whilst seeming to reproduce a condition of \u2018post-political\u2019 closure, as austerity deepens and contradictions sharpen these modes of local governance face mounting dissent from a growing part with no part. In this context, the political horizon of local government is an ambivalent one.

London has more railway termini than any other world city, with apparent economic, social and spatial differences between places located in front of them and those behind. Contemporary research focuses on transport functions, on the economic potential of station buildings and on the potential for rail to increase catalyse redevelopment, while ignoring their role as the largest buildings in the city, creating separation within the street network. This thesis analyses eight main London railway termini in two time periods: the 1880s and the 2010s. These stations are served by different infrastructure types, from cuttings to viaducts, which form movement barriers in areas located behind them, which are also associated with social decline and post-industrial redevelopment. Space syntax analysis uncovers the impacts of railway termini and their associated structures on movement networks. The economic and social character of areas around the stations is then analysed, to identify differences between neighbourhoods in front of and behind stations. Historical data is mapped and compared with contemporary data, including land uses for both periods and social data from the Booth Poverty Survey, which is compared to contemporary income estimates. Analysis of spatial, social and economic character shows how the railway has influenced neighbourhoods located behind termini over a long period of time. The nature of this influence depends on infrastructure type, viaducts being associated with less separation than other railway structures. This research is significant for the long-term redevelopment of railway termini, demonstrating their importance as an integral part of the city and the significance of understanding the separation they create.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Thomas Bolton"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "City Tour London", "short_title": "City Tour London", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning", "abstract": "From time immemorial, London\u2019s myriad visitors have been drawn to the traditional sights and attractions of the West End.

The long-term sustainability of the town centre has been shown to correspond to its configurational spatial signatures. Where high streets exhibit a high ethnic diversity amongst proprietors, there appears to be a corresponding diversity of land use and goods, with a tendency to adapt and alter space for greater economic benefit. Small independent units are often further subdivided to accommodate a greater number of services and products. In the context of the local high street in the UK, the small independent Minority Ethnic Business (MEB) is a common feature, whether it is a halal butcher, an Indian chemist or a Chinese takeaway, serving both an embedded local minority community as well as often having a wider mainstream appeal. This paper seeks to examine the relationship between spatial configuration and socio-economic diversity of the local high street to investigate whether the potential for diversity is embedded in its contextual spatial characteristics. For the purpose of this study using nationally defined town centre boundaries, ten town centre case studies were selected from around London based on their residential ethnic profile and the level of deprivation of the area. Building on the literature that shows that land use diversity is associated with the persistence of smaller town centres, we test the proposition that it is also associated with the presence of MEBs. Here we tested the degree of impact of MEB presence on commercial diversity across these case studies. Additionally, the study examines the spatial and morphological signatures of these case studies and how these relate to the context of MEB presence and land use diversity, finding a strong relationship between spatial and urban form factors and a greater presence of MEBs. The study concludes that given the importance of spatial accessibility coupled with built form diversity to the presence of MEBs, greater attention needs to be given to the embedded social value in the spatial characteristics of town centres.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Laura Vaughn|Sadaf Sultan Khan|Lusine Tarkhanyan|Ashley Dhanani"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Skateboard City", "short_title": "London in Skateboarding Films", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture", "abstract": "London has been part of the worldwide phenomenon of skateboarding, from the early 1970s right through to the present day.

A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.", "partners": "J.

On the other hand, it is argued that there are emerging clusters of ownership similarly actively managed. However, little is known yet about why property owners choose to cluster their portfolios, challenging risk diversification theories, what their active management comprises and in what institutional context they operate. Using an institutional account, this research examines clusters of ownership exploring their investment and management strategies and how the institutional environment affects these strategies. Methodologically, this research follows a multiple case study design and combines quantitative and qualitative methods, with predominantly qualitative methods. Quantitative data sources include the annual reports of property companies, which were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative methods include semi-structured interviews with cluster owners and other stakeholders, which were analysed using content analysis. Research findings suggest that property owners derive a threefold advantage from clustering and actively managing their property portfolio. First, they gain an edge over the market including new acquisitions by their detailed local knowledge and concentrated ownerships. Second, they deploy an instrumentalised form of place-making in their neighbourhood by curating the mix of uses and tenant mix, their placement, and the space in-between the buildings. Third, they can occupy some of the empty governance space left by a budget-strapped planning system.

Understanding why businesses in some industries cluster is a key issue in urban economic theory, particularly in the Marshallian and Jacobsian traditions. These emphasize the logistical and informational synergies (advantages) that accrue to firms in agglomeration economies, allowing firms located near one another to accelerate their rate of innovation. However, little is known about how spatial forms foster the clustering of firms or the mechanisms through which this process might facilitate knowledge spillover over between different businesses. In this paper we present an historical case study in which space syntax methods, archival research and urban economic theory were used to enhance understanding of the spatial ordering of London's nineteenth-and early twentieth-century furniture industry, a sector characterised by a proliferation of small, local firms. The spatial morphologies of the furniture industry in the Shoreditch and Fitzrovia areas of London are profiled by linking business directories, historical Ordnance Survey maps and Goad fire insurance plans to space syntax measures describing the spatial configuration of London's street network, on a GIS platform. Historically, the two casestudy areas have hosted a wide range of furniture-manufacturing businesses. We hypothesise that the contrast between the spatial structures of the two districts contributed to the divergent paths development of the furniture industry in these places. Our results suggest the two areas developed as different knowledge economies, in part as a consequence of their contrasting spatial configurations and their influence on industrial organization. Shoreditch became a 'specialization' economy (i.e. Marshallian). Here the organic pattern of streets allowed specialized businesses to be located in close proximity to key streets, benefiting from more local footfall, and in close localization of firms belonging to the same industry. Fitzrovia, however, showed a more 'diversified' economy (i.e. Jacobsian), accommodating most of its retailers on streets highly integrated across scales and more commercially-driven. In the context of constraints of land use and rising land values, manufacturing operations moved to other places whilst retaining large-size firms that created a retail destination in a high footfall location good for attracting passing trade. We anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the distinctive spatial cultures of urban manufacturing and to the development of a methodological approach that opens up new prospects for inter-disciplinary research.", "partners": "Laura Narvaez Zertuche", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "Co-authorship with industry partner(s), Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Sam Griffiths|Blerta Dino|Laura Vaughan|Laura Narvaez Zertuche|Howard Davis"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Revealing local economies in London", "short_title": "Revealing local economies in London", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning", "abstract": "The economy of London is often characterised as global, productive and competitive on a world stage, the engine of the nation. It is also experienced daily by workers and other citizens driving vehicles, serving in shops, caring for each other, cleaning, starting businesses and struggling to succeed or even survive. The city\u2019s economy generates immense wealth but also alarming levels of in-work poverty. Official accounts of the economy tend to emphasise high-productivity sectors, increasingly concentrated in office blocks in the centre, while half the activity is distributed through the city and made up of small enterprises and interlocking sub-contractors. The pressure on these activities is increasingly intense because of the inflated prices which land commands if shifted into use for housing development. Thus there has been a great deal of displacement in recent decades and there is growing controversy about how much workspace London can afford to lose. Furthermore the economy faces two major uncertainties in the next few years: the revision of business rates which threatens many enterprises and the consequences of Brexit, via changes in the terms of trade, inflation and curbs on labour mobility. Researchers at UCL\u2019s Bartlett School have just published the report on a small research project evaluating the various ways in which the diverse economies of London are understood, studied and planned for. Principal findings of the research are that Top-down studies of the London economy fail to connect with the growing number of Borough-level and bottom-up studies of economic activity in localities. This seriously weakens policy-making. Community groups and local business networks often have a strong understanding of the inter-connections between activities but these tend not to be assimilated into policy studies. Some standardisation of methodologies used in local studies would help to build a strategic picture and would generate the kind of local audits which need to preceed and inform policy decisions. Statisticians, planners and economists need to give more thought to some of the key concepts and categories which are used or needed in the analysis and understanding of local economies at various scales. There is great potential for productive discussion among statisticians, planners and economists at the various levels of government, resident and business communities in localities, and researchers. A shared repository of studies is needed so that best practice can more easily be shared and to avoid each study reinventing the wheel. Longitudinal studies of workers, firms and localities are never done but are essential if policy is to be adequately grounded in an understanding of how the city\u2019s economies interact and how planning can optimise conditions for all concerned.

Lack of modal choice, route options, the cost of using public transport, and wider cultural norms are a few of the barriers to realizing a more sustainable transport network.

It seeks to identify the spatial conditions that, at multiple scales, mediate and support the operation of digital industries in inner-city locations. Drawing on \u2018productionist\u2019 approaches, which examine creative industries as an industry, work is conceptualized as six activities (producing, meeting, networking, learning, displaying, socializing) performed across four spatial settings: the extended workplace, workspaces, industry events, and the neighbourhood. This qualitative case study uses three data collection methods: semi-structured interviews with workers and industry actors, observations of selected settings, and secondary data. The area is an emergent cluster of digital firms known as \u2018Silicon Roundabout\u2019 and \u2018Tech City\u2019, providing a less explored but relevant case. The thesis\u2019 contribution is threefold. First, it provides an empirical account of the spatiality of digital work in Shoreditch. This reveals a network of spaces used for work (base, ancillary, and events) suggesting a reconfiguration, and extension, of the \u2018workplace\u2019 in these industries. This spatial extension is limited and associated with spatial requirements of the tasks involved; the office still plays a central role in digital production. Second, the study identifies macro and micro spatial conditions that mediate and support these work patterns across the four spatial settings and advances the conceptualization of functional, social, and symbolic aspects of these relationships, expanding the understanding of why and how place matters in the digital economy. Third, the analysis reveals that \u2018structured interaction\u2019 and micro processes of spatial segregation and exclusion are critical to support a range of work and social practices in digital production. In contrast to influential accounts that associate creative cities with diversity and tolerance, at the scale of these spatial practices, processes of selection and quest for sameness underpin the operation of these industries within urban space(s).", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Juliana Borowozyk Martins"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.078017, 51.511861]]}, "properties": {"name": "City of London", "full_title": "A material history of the City of London, 1945-1993", "short_title": "A material history of the City of London", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture", "abstract": "Much of the current anxiety surrounding the financial system has emerged because of its perceived obscurity, scale and intangibility. The digitalisation and deregulation of the industry since the 1950s has been at the heart of this fear, giving rise to a situation whereby the more complex and rapid financial transactions become, the less visible and less easily regulated they are. Consequently the global economy is often perceived to be a black box within which immaterial capital-flows circulate, unencumbered by the inconveniences of geography or the built environment. Yet the reality of this system is far from friction free. The world of financial services is orchestrated around people and places, co-ordinated through infrastructure and architecture, and accommodated in offices and cities. While the financial transaction itself may be an immaterial act, it relies upon a set of specific material conditions to take place. This thesis is an exploration of those conditions. Through an analysis of the urban and architectural development of the City of London, London\u2019s financial district, in the post-war period, the research considers the extent to which there is a relationship between the structure of the financial system and the structure of the environment in which it operates. This thesis is the first comprehensive material investigation of a financial centre to date. Furthermore, it is the first study that can claim to have looked at the recent architectural history of the City of London in any depth. Buttressed by two episodes of destructive violence \u2013 World War II and the IRA bombings of the early 90s \u2013 which would each herald a new urban paradigm, the research charts the gradual deregulation of the UK finance industry and its manifestation in the built form, socio-spatial arrangement, and cultural milieu of the financial centre. Structured in the shape of a conceptual cross-section, the thesis is organised into four chapters that move from the urban scale of the City, through its streets, across its facades and into the micro-geography of its interiors, in the form of trading floors, offices and furniture. The aim is not to provide a descriptive inventory of buildings and streets, but rather to connect each material layer to the wider economic and regulatory developments in the global economy, thereby creating a constant dialogue between financial place and financial space.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Amy Thomas"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Variability in Regularity", "short_title": "Temporal Mobility Patterns with Smart-Card Data", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis", "abstract": "To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understanding of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.", "partners": "Transport for London|", "funders": "European Research Council (ERC)", "partnership_types": "Co-authorship with other partner(s), Data support", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Chen Zhong|Michael Batty|Ed Manley|Jiaqiu Wang|Zijia Wang|Feng Chen|Gerhard Schmitt"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Southbank Skateboarding, London and Urban Culture", "short_title": "Southbank Skateboarding and Urban Culture", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture", "abstract": "Over the last two years, skateboarding space in London has been subject to considerable controversy, debate and development.

We specifically considered information and communication technology (ICT), new types of mobility services such as car sharing, electric cars and residential preferences. In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture. We identify such interventions for each segment and region and conclude that comparative assessment of attitudinal, alongside geographical, characteristics of metropolitan travellers can provide better strategic input for realistic scenario-building and ex-ante assessment of sustainable transport policy.", "partners": "1.

The contribution of this research is it represents a proof of concept in the use of community detection techniques in the definition of spatial housing submarket.

To work towards the concept of MaaS-London, first, the supply and the demand sides of the London transport market are analysed. There are a variety of mobility services supplied in London such as car clubs (car sharing), ride sharing, bike sharing, public transport, rail and taxi which altogether make London an ideal ground to exploit MaaS-London. The MaaS-London is an integrated platform that includes registration and package selection, intermodal journey planning, booking, smart ticketing and payment functions so that the entire chain of transport can be managed in this centralised platform. The most outstanding feature of MaaS-London is the provision of mobility packages, which consist of tailored bundles of mobility services customised to individual needs. The feasibility study indicates that the introduction of MaaS-London will benefit both the supply and the demand side. Transport operators will benefit by creating a larger market via the integrated platform.

The core inquiry applies a configurational analysis to the street, viewing it as a complex entity which interfaces with both buildings and the urban street network.

The thesis looks at architecture beyond function, geometry and aesthetics, focusing on the urban street as a generator for social contact. Building on space syntax theory, it seeks to advance the concept of the \u2018virtual community\u2019, proposing that encounter and co-presence patterns are the product of both city-wide connections and local building morphology.

The thesis is innovative in integrating space syntax and Conzenian methods to better examine the micromorphology of the street interface configurationally and typologically, capturing the changing nature of built form and building use over time. This methodology is applied to the study of two contrasting urban areas: Islington, London and West Village, Manhattan. Both possess similar building morphologies that have sustained street liveability and diversity over centuries.

Supervised and operated via its members, the components of each institution were tied together through a mode of exchange that prized face-to-face contact, reputation and trust, epitomised by the Stock Exchange motto Dictum Meum Pactum (\u2018My word is my bond\u2019). The latter was made concrete via messenger-operated payment and clearing systems, organised around the hours of trade, provoking the need for proximity between institutions and specific architectural arrangements and resulting in an urban agglomeration of banks and other institutions in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England.

In recent years, the focus of economic development initiatives has shifted away from supply side initiatives, such as fiscal incentives and the direct provision of premises, towards a consideration of the collective provision of infrastructure and services, in order to meet demands of businesses and workers in cities where there is already strong demand and growth. As well as this shift from supply- to demand-side initiatives, there has been a change in the political ideological approach to land and property development, away from public sector direct provision and funding, to place greater onus on the private sector to deliver development, infrastructure and services. The introduction of \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 planning policies by local authorities in London from the early 2000s is part of this shift \u2013 building on more established key worker and affordable housing policies. This paper evaluates the success of affordable workspace planning policies in thirteen mixed use schemes in London, from the perspectives of developers and workspace providers, who are responsible for delivering and managing the affordable workspace. First, it finds that the perspective of the developer, in particular whether it sees affordable workspace policy as (a) an opportunity, (b) a \u2018tool\u2019 to secure planning permission or (c) a burden, is mostly influenced by the way in which the affordable workspace emerged within the proposal. Developers\u2019 perspectives and the success of their partnerships with workspace providers are critical to the successful delivery of affordable workspace within the scheme. Second, the findings show that \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 is difficult to define and deliver, with different interpretations used by delivery partners and the ability of workspace providers to deliver affordability depends critically on their organisational model. Finally, the research shows that although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, it is not benefiting low-value manufacturers or small family-run retail and service businesses, nor is it generally benefiting start-ups. The implications of policy outcomes for economic development are considered; overall the beneficial impacts are limited. The research concludes that the predominant model of affordable workspace policy being promoted in London will fail to meet the aspirations of policy makers, with the limited success of policy further compounded by the global recession of the late-2000s.

Adopting the hegemonic political and economic theories of Neoliberalism on the general and macro level, and the more specific theories of place marketing on the micro level, this research argues that place marketing is one of the neoliberal imaginaries used to legitimate neoliberal practices, such as Olympic land acquisition. The author connects the abstract theories of Neoliberalism and the concrete theories of place marketing with Sklair\u2019s Transnational Capitalist Class (2001) theory which suggests the formation of globally mobile elites who with their highly mobile capital have become very influential in the staging of urban mega-events and mega projects. In the particular case of the Olympic Games, some of these mobile capitalists have been very active in providing official sponsorship in exchange of exclusive marketing rights to associate their brands with the Olympics. Based on reviews of major Olympic-related official documents, a news survey on national, city and local newspapers and 31 elite interviews covering official place marketers of London, local governments, regional governmental bodies, Olympic Delivery Authority, official Olympic sponsors, small business owners and NGOs, this study points out the conflict of interests between place marketers and product marketers at the junction of urban mega-events. Understanding London\u2019s top world city status and taking into account the desire to host the Olympic Games for a third time in response to fierce inter-city competition, this research indicates how place marketing is in theory a development strategy but in practice a difficult task due to the financial dilemmas and legal issues faced by neoliberalised governments. Legislations passed and contracts signed specifically for the Olympic Games have provided priorities and exclusive rights to official sponsors who are the product marketers in this case over place marketers.

However, decision-making involves the everyday life of using and navigating in the built environment to the management of urban space. This paper seeks to understand the basic notion of how pedestrian movement is related to land use choices in the built form. The hypothesis is that movement itself involves a choice; that is, a decision-making of direction and destination, of passing through or of static behaviour. The density of movement flow is seen as a result of locations that potentially become attractors that have a rich distribution of land use. How we accommodate and modulate movement is thus important in helping us understand the multiple effects of everyday use that arises from decision-making processes and its subsequent effectuation in the configuration of urban space. Therefore, two key questions are addressed: first, how the types of movement choices influence and are influenced by the spatial layout; and second, how the distribution of land uses is affected by such choices. The paper uses Space Syntax and Game theory as a combination of theoretical frameworks that study independent and interdependent decision-making processes in urban space, to answer these questions. Taking the River Thames Path as an example, the research project focuses on the unconnected section of the river walk between London Bridge and Southwark Bridge.

The first five novels each written Le Carr\u00e9 and Deighton were published in the period 1960-1970. Although both authors and these specific works have remained popular in genre spy fiction, there has been little consideration of the works in relation to each other and in their role together in situating the potential threats of the post-war period in a UK domestic setting rather than on mainland Europe. The transition of Fleming\u2019s novels into film starting with \u2018Dr No\u2019 in 1962 suggested that UK spies engaging in espionage undertook this in exotic locations which were far removed from everyday life. An examination of the fiction of Deighton and Le Carr\u00e9 suggests a different world where the locus of external danger was in the suburban midst of Surrey or Wood Green.

I draw from architectural history, feminist and queer theory as well as geographies of sexualities to interrogate the stability of domesticity. Highlighting everyday homemaking practices of more than 40 non-heterosexual households in London, I seek to complicate one overarching regime of power that dominates our cultural value system: heteronormativity \u2013 the idea that normative heterosexuality is the default sexuality to which everyone must conform or declare themselves against. The project is a response to three decades of academic research that has looked at the spatialised ways in which sexual identity unfolds in, for the most part, peripheral zones in the \u2018Western\u2019 metropolis, spaces beyond the domestic realm. This thesis takes a different architectural approach; one where through interviewing 47 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Londoners, as well as eleven domestic tradespeople that work in these homes, agency is given to small-scale domestic interventions and everyday actions. The concept of \u2018queering\u2019 is important to the framework, which, in the context of the thesis, is understood as an on-going process that LGBTQ people are engaged in through homemaking and daily living. Although some participants may not see this as a political act, I argue otherwise and suggest queering at home is a form of political activism. Through mundane domestic actions the overarching structure of heteronormativity might be challenged. I contend that queering the home unfolds in various, complex and conflicting ways. The thesis seeks to provoke both queer theory and politics, by opening up existing approaches and remits to allow room for a domestic method.

This thesis argues that the language of public participation is not used politically for describing extra-discursive realities about public participation. Instead, it is used performatively and, as such, the politics of public participation involves a struggle between actors over the institutionalisation of particular configurations of social relations around the planning process. It also argues that this struggle is strategic and directed at the achievement of certain planning outcomes, which would be more difficult if another configuration were institutionalised. Therefore, this thesis analyses the storylines of public participation as a significant category of political analysis, and investigates the strategic use of participatory storylines by the GLA planners as they struggled over competing planning agendas. This is conduced also in the context of a variety of interests of other actors that competed against that of the planners during the London Plan making process. The research contributes to an understanding of how planners conceptualise public participation in a variety of innovative ways through performative discursive actions and how they shape planning outcomes by altering existing social relations within planning processes. It also demonstrates how their discursive actions have limited influence in planning institutions with unequal authority positions and how the planning outcomes are seemingly determined by structural forces beyond their control.

In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society.

The changing network structure of the street systems of two outer suburban areas of Greater London, Surbiton and South Norwood, are analysed from the 1880s onwards. A temporal reading of the process of urban growth in relation to the historic street network of local centres allows for a nuanced understanding of the way in which cities grow over time. Rather than conceptualising suburban growth as either a seeding of new territories in tabula rasa or a \u2018swallowing-up\u2019 of older settlements, this article argues for a measured description of the spatial, social and economic properties of urban grid intensification. This research uses digitised historical maps, historical and contemporary land-use data together with space syntax analysis in order to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in London\u2019s suburban street network from the 1880s. The analysis demonstrates that over the period of time considered there have been distinct stages in the spatial development of the city\u2019s urban fringe. The results show that as London expanded to encircle new territories, the spatial relationships of fringe areas of the city changed markedly as larger scale infrastructure was built and local development intensified, with the effect of reconfiguring the local network of the case study suburbs. However, detailed analysis of the formation of suburban town centres using space syntax also uncovers distinctive and resilient spatial morphologies which have sustained varied modes of land use over time. Drawing on the theory of the urban \u2018movement economy\u2019 and our previous research in this area, the article shows how the complex balance of change and continuity realised in the spatial morphology of the suburban high street can be explained by complex scalar mechanisms of adaptability.

This thesis investigates possible flood-borne and damp-related pathogens in flooded London dwellings, and the potential duration of microbial contamination risk following a flood event. Microbiological laboratory work and models are used to characterise microbial risk within flooded dwellings. Dwelling archetypes representative of the London housing stock are developed and hygrothermal simulation techniques used to model the flooding and drying behaviour of the archetypes under different scenarios in order to predict the duration of damp and microbial risk inside typical dwellings. The results of the combined biological and hygrothermal models are mapped alongside existing flood risk maps in order to predict areas in London susceptible to long-term microbial risk or prolonged displacement following a flood. Highlights of the research findings include the following (i) The persistence of bacterial contaminants on flooded materials is related to the type of floodwater, the drying conditions including temperature and drying rate, and the material drying characteristics, ii) Different dwellings in London have different drying behaviours due to their built form and dominant wall types, with modern purpose-built flats the most prone to long-term damp and microbial risk following a flood event, (iii) The flood height, external weather, and internal conditions including heating and ventilation can have a major impact on the length of time a dwelling will remain at risk of microbial contamination, and (iv) The concentration of properties vulnerable to long-term microbial exposure following major flood events is highest in areas of South and East London, particularly Southwark.", "partners": "", "funders": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), EPSRC: EP/G029881/1, PE/F007132/1", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Jonathon Taylor"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Building characteristics as determinants of propensity to high indoor summer temperatures in London dwellings", "short_title": "Building characteristics and high indoor summer temperatures", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Sustainability", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources", "abstract": "Cities are expected to experience an increasing risk of overheating due to climate change and the urban heat island phenomenon.

This paper presents the results of EnergyPlus dynamic thermal simulations of 3456 combinations of dwelling types and characteristics selected to represent the London domestic stock. Two Design Summer Year weather files were used to represent the current and future climate: the CIBSE 1984\u20132004 and a UKCP09 future weather file (50th percentile of external temperature, 2050s, medium emissions scenario). Appreciable variation between dwelling types but generally greater variation within dwelling type was found depending on such factors as orientation, surrounding buildings and insulation levels. Under the current climate, the insulation levels had considerable impact on indoor temperatures, with combined retrofitting of roof insulation and window upgrades reducing daytime living room temperatures during the warmest continuous 5-day period of modelling by, on average, 0.76 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.63, 0.89 \u00b0C) for mean temperature and 1.30 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 1.05, 1.54 \u00b0C) for maximum temperature. On the other hand, internally retrofitted walls and floors tended to increase daytime living room temperatures, with a combined effect of 0.46 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.33, 0.60 \u00b0C) increase in mean temperature and 0.71 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.47, 0.96) increase in maximum temperature.

Identifying the determinant factors for energy demand and thermal comfort across a city is hence a key requirement for energy efficient retrofit and public health strategies. The aim of this thesis was to assess the relative impact of urban warming, built form and fabric characteristics on domestic energy use and overheating risk across a major city, using London as a case study. Two housing stock models were developed: a heat demand model based on steady-state energy use calculation techniques and a multiple linear regression overheating risk meta-model of an existing dynamic thermal simulation program. Input data was derived from existing Geographic Information System databases, national housing surveys and local urban air temperature models. The heat demand model successfully reproduced the ranking of urban areas based on their actual gas consumption (R\u00b2 = 0.817) in a case study area containing 8.6% of London's dwelling stock. The heat island was found to decrease the average annual domestic heating load by 14% in these urban areas compared to a rural reference site. It was shown that the overheating meta-model can replicate the output of the thermal simulation program (R\u00b2 = 0.763). It was indicated that highly exposed dwelling types, such as top floor flats and bungalows, as well as internally insulated buildings are likely to present an indoor overheating problem during periods of hot weather. However, the agreement between modelled overheating levels and monitored data collected in 101 London homes in summer 2009 was relatively weak, thus highlighting the modifying role of occupant controlled ventilation for indoor thermal conditions.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Anna Mavrogianni"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Planning for markets", "short_title": "Planning for markets", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources", "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest amongst policy makers in the market\u2019s potential role in contributing to solutions in key social and economic public policy agendas.

To date, very little is known about the contemporary relevance of markets and specifically why markets have been prioritised in retail planning policy and received public policy interest. This paper investigates these issues further. Through a literature review, it develops a conceptual and contextual framework for understanding markets. It then draws on empirical research, i.e. survey and interview data from a study of London boroughs and a case study of one London Local Authority (Camden), to highlight the effects of current day-to-day management and planning approaches in sustaining markets. The research demonstrates that the contemporary role of the market is multidimensional, e.g. they appear to play significant roles as managed public space but also act as an important social and economic space, particularly for marginal social groups. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that, whilst proactive planning policies do not guarantee a vibrant market, they can play a key part in protecting their permanent loss; however, equally important is the supportive management approaches taken in shaping their social survival.

It attempts to correct the misunderstandings in Marxian land rent theory and develop it for an urban context. The four categories of land rent of differential rent, differential rent 2, absolute rent, and monopoly rent are critically re-examined. Subsequently, the combination of absolute rent and differential rent is suggested as a general structure for land rents in an urban context. The dynamic mechanism of changes in land rents is explained with the concepts of emulation, differentiation and shift between groups of houses based on the structure of land rents. The process of the formation of housing submarkets has been examined for a practical preparation for empirical analysis and a theoretical basis for the subdivision of the housing market. Spatial submarkets are identified by focusing on the interactive relationship between residential spheres (a unit consisting of a centre of employment and the surrounding residential area). Sectoral submarkets are defined based on social and environmental features as well as the structural features of dwellings. For empirical analysis, three metropolitan cities were chosen: London as monocentric, Seoul as tri-centric and Los Angeles as polycentric. Empirical analysis has used commuting patterns and the contours of house prices as the criteria to identify spatial submarkets with the help of network analysis and GIS. Simple OLS regression analysis of house prices on the accessibility to centre was conducted in each identified submarket. The results were used to explore the structure of and the dynamic changes in land rents. A consistent structure of land rents was observed in each housing submarket across all three cities. The implication on the condition of labour reproduction was drawn out by interpreting the changes in land rents over a period of 10 years in each city. The analysis of London revealed a monocentric housing market structure and the suitability of commuting time over physical distance as an accessibility variable. In Seoul\u201fs case, the transition from tri-centric to monocentric housing market was observed and a comparative approach with rent and price data enriched the interpretation of the changes in the structure of the housing market.

It found actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways between current material configurations and social practices for these reconfigurations. Material configurations include infrastructures, urban form, fixtures, fittings, and water types. Social practices, include existing behaviours, imagined behaviours, desires, and aspirations. This is an important question to answer because there are many places around the world, both in developed and developing countries that currently face inadequate water supplies to serve the needs of their ever growing populations, or conversely flooding due to extreme precipitation or sea level rise. The lower Lea river basin in London is one such area. The large scale engineering solutions of pipes and pumps to control water that have been the typical solution are reaching their limits therefore it is imperative to find other means to manage water in urban environments. This research used an actor-network theory co-evolution framework to understand the existing urban water-cycle, and to find areas of transformation in order to develop actor-network co-evolutionary pathways for change. Interviews, group discussions and water diaries were used to investigate the existing conditions and anticipated future changes of both private citizens and water professionals. An iterative process of design synthesis and discussions were repeated twice to test and define the actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways. This research stretches actor-network theory from its ethnographic beginnings into the realm of the future through design propositions. It found that there were two strongly favoured actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways for reconfiguring the urban water-cycle in the lower Lea river basin. These were increasing freshwater productivity and transforming waste to resource.

Contemporary world cities are characterised by high levels of economic specialisation between intra-urban centres, an expanding regional scope, and market-led processes of development. These issues have been given relatively little attention in sustainable travel research, yet are increasingly defining urban structures, and need to be much better understood if improvements to urban transport sustainability are to be achieved. London has been argued to be the core of a polycentric urban region, and currently there is mixed evidence on the various sustainability and efficiency merits of more decentralised urban forms. The focus of this research is to develop analytical tools to investigate the links between urban economic geography and transportation sustainability; and apply these tools to the case study of the London region. An innovative methodology for the detailed spatial analysis of urban form, employment geography and transport sustainability is developed for this research, with a series of new application of GIS and spatial data to urban studies. Firstly an intra-metropolitan scale of spatial analysis is pursued, allowing both an extensive regional scope and a sufficiently intensive local level of detail to analyse the decentralisation processes described above. Secondly a series of detailed spatial datasets are introduced to analyse employment geography and dynamics, including business survey data and fine-scale real-estate data. For the measurement of accessibility, detailed network analysis and congestion data is used. Finally for the assessment of transportation sustainability, an indicator of CO2 emissions at intra-urban scales is developed, and is calculated for the 6.5 million journey-to-work trips in the study region.

The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure.Methods: Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with high or very high exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure.Results: Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a high or very high risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between high or very high exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to no exposure likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for number of residents and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern.Conclusion: This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit.

LSPs were set up to establish inclusive, collaborative and strategic approach at the local level. The main tasks of LSPs are to establish the Community Strategy, the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy and the areas of allocation of the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund with aims of reflecting local needs are for neighbourhood renewals. Because LSP consists of various stakeholders in various policy areas at different administrative levels, it would be difficult to reach agreements among them and to produce tangible output. This thesis explores preconditions of the LSPs approaches, two-way communications for formulating strategies, reaching consensus between members of LSPs and reflecting local needs to such strategies, and contributions to local communities. Then, it discusses what forces determine styles of operation of LSPs, why LSPs encounter difficulties in discussions in the decision making process and why LSPs have difficulties in shaping strategies of the partners' organisations. Firstly, this thesis develops a new evaluation framework for the strategies-making programme and public participation programmes, which may find practical use, based on the literature reviews of both academic research papers and government guidance on participative planning approach. Secondly, through reviews of government guidance on LSP approaches, this thesis established hypotheses for resolving the above mentioned questions by considering the new evaluation framework. Thirdly, in order to verify hypotheses, it uses the results of a questionnaire survey, a one-year observation of the board meetings, and an interview survey which examines the ways that the process operated for the strategy-making in four LSPs in inner London boroughs namely, Camden, Hackney, Lambeth and Wandsworth.

Following a literature review, and some definitions of the subject matter, there is an analysis of transport data, including the historic use of motorcycles, and policy documents at a national, regional and local level informs a discussion on the utility of motorcycles within a sustainable transport strategy, and its implementation by London Boroughs. As well as examining travel patterns in London, the thesis details the characteristics of London motorcyclists and what differentiates them from riders elsewhere in the UK. The thesis considers some issues associated with the use of motorcycles that help inform policy and strategy at both the national and the local level. These include safety, emissions, noise, congestion and use of the road space. These issues are then tested through case studies of policies and strategies produced by two the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Harrow. The final section compares the characteristics of motorcycles against the requirements of a sustainable transport system and summarises the positive and negative contributions that motorcycles can make. This thesis attempts to answer the questions: Do motorcycles represent a more sustainable transport mode than the private car in Greater London Could an increase in motorcycle use, at the expense of either car or public transport use, have a significant impact on the sustainability of transport in London Would encouraging motorcycle use present a more sustainable approach to London overall, in terms of secondary environmental measures What role can land-use planning have in assisting motorcycle use The thesis concludes that motorcycles do have a role to play in helping to achieve a more sustainable transport system in London, but this is to some extent, dependent on the type and location of journey the vehicle is used for.

In London, it is beginning to shape estate renewal delivery practices, with the buoyant housing market utilised to deliver the cross subsidy needed to rebuild ailing social housing provision. The Mayor's London Plan is pushing for a more compact city, which along with the 50% target for all housing development to be 'affordable' is also serving to push proposed densities on estate renewal schemes higher. Related to this is the concept of mixing communities to achieve a critical mass of social change and alleviate so called negative 'area effects'. While a range of policy goals are suggested in the pursuit of such policies, the government has not been explicit in setting clear objectives against which policy delivery can be tested. This dissertation analyses current research into high density and mixed tenure development. It seeks to better understand the impacts when the two outcomes are combined in the London context. Six case studies taken from current research are analysed against the proposed Woodberry Down estate renewal scheme, one of a number of emerging redevelopment projects based on emerging delivery practices towards high density, mixed tenure communities. A range of barriers to effective implementation are identified, which could impact upon identified goals. The reality is that as pressure grows to deliver more housing and facilities, with less land and government subsidy, these barriers will be traded off each other by local politicians in the hope of achieving the best possible outcome under increasingly difficult circumstances.

Urban design, applied with the aim of enhancing a sense of place, may also be particularly important in the traditionally 'placeless' suburban context. Following the 2004 Planning and Compensation Act, urban design frameworks began to emerge for suburban town centres in London. They are important and demand analysis, because they represent modern urban design in London moving beyond the city core into mixed-use suburban areas. Any analysis of this phenomenon must also include awareness of the implications of the London Plan, setting as it does the strategic planning context for all suburban design frameworks. Three differing case study design frameworks were selected for detailed investigation. In most cases, micro-scale design objectives within the study area were well-formulated. However, issues relating to their wider context often appeared problematic, notably the frameworks' relationship with neighbouring centres, enhancement of local distinctiveness, and their attitude towards environmental sustainability. With the relatively monocentric London Plan ignoring the important potential contribution of London's suburbs to city-region growth and sustainability, the regional planning context thus generated encourages the pariochiality highlighted within the case study design frameworks. A realignment of regional policy, particularly the formulation of strategic design goals, might offer suburban town centres more opportunity to contribute to London's growth and sustainability. According to case study evidence, such realignment should incorporate promotion of orbital public transport corridors, coordination of complementary or 'niche' roles for town centres enhancing any existing local sense of place, and top-down integration of environmental sustainability from regional to local level. This new strategic planning and design context might represent an achievable first stage towards a more sustainable, polycentric pattern of development for London.", "partners": "Stewart Clark of the London Borough of Bromley, |Brian Hodge and Paul Garrett of the London Borough of Merton and |Murray Broad of the London Borough of Redbridge.", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "Public engagement", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Jesse Honey"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "What if? the next London Plan were better?", "short_title": "What if? the next London Plan were better?", "kef_theme": "Local growth and regeneration", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning", "abstract": "The paper presents a critique of procedures and substance in the London Plan, summarising and extending evidence the author was invited to give to the Examination in Public of the Plan.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Michael Edwards"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Individualism, egalitarianism, hierarchy and fatalism in London housing associations, 1988-2003", "short_title": "1988-2003: A study of housing management and cultural change", "kef_theme": "Public and community engagement", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture", "abstract": "This thesis investigates management change in housing associations in London since the Housing Act of 1988. Previous work on housing management has tended to focus on the adoption of new public management principles, assuming that policy from 1988 has resulted in a cultural shift towards individualism. This study makes use of 'grid-group' cultural theory to challenge this assumption by tracking all four 'cultures' within housing association management: egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism as well as individualism. As a detailed qualitative analysis of the voluntary housing sector, it addresses a neglected field of study within public policy. London provides rich ground for analysis of cultural change in the voluntary housing sector. It has a higher concentration of housing associations than any other UK city, it is where most of the larger housing organisations originated and it is the site of the greatest development activity throughout the period. London housing associations encapsulate all the significant changes in housing management resulting from the reforms of the 1980s. Whilst the study finds evidence of individualistic philosophy, particularly amongst senior housing association managers, it also finds evidence of egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism. Egalitarianism remains as the legacy of housing associations' historical origins and organisational structures. Hierarchy results from an increasingly dominant role for a small number of large, elite organisations, which become more hierarchical as they grow. Fatalism has emerged as a prevalent ethos amongst front-line staff, reflected and reinforced by the increasingly negative experience of residents. The thesis reveals how, contrary to the expectations of the 1988 Act, an overall shift 'up-grid' towards hierarchalism and fatalism emerged as the most significant response.", "partners": "48 local participants", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "Anonymous Public Engagement", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Tony Manzi"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A critical examination of recent developments in public participation in urban regeneration with particular reference to Spitalfields, east London", "short_title": "Public participation in urban regeneration", "kef_theme": "Public and community engagement", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning", "abstract": "Community participation in urban regeneration has advanced significantly since the Skeffington report was published over 35 years ago.

New institutional landscapes are being formed across London and power is increasingly diffused across multiple sectors under a new multi-level network pattern of governance. The new institutional arrangements for London and the inauguration of the Greater London Authority in particular embody the contradictory New Labour modernisation agenda displaying evidence of centralism, managerialism and localism at the same time (Brooks, 1999). In London Thames Gateway the omnipresence of the central state is revealed despite the 'devolution' of power to a new citywide Mayor. This also suggests that Government is increasingly being 'hollowed-out' (Houghton and Counsell, 2004) but that central Government continues to 'steer' the course. If the last few years are anything to go by spatial planning and strategic planning projects in particular, are back in vogue. As in the post-war period London is faced with a projected population and jobs explosion, although for very different reasons. 'Big bang' strategic planning has returned with a vengeance but for London Thames Gateway the same old questions remain: delivery---how, who and where The current institutional apparatus continues to confuse and bemuse and this study is about contributing towards the task of converting paper plans and a multitude of competing urban visions into lived reality. A broader reconfiguration of the state, economy and civil society means that a more sophisticated understanding is required to get to grips with the different actors involved within networks and the relationships of these networks. In the context of institutional fragmentation London Thames Gateway is used as a 'window' into the current institutional framework to see how the New Labour modernisation agenda is working 'on the ground'. The study uses semi-structured interviews across the various governance tiers (i.e. central Government, pan-London and sub-regional levels) to analyse the internal and external working relationships of the various actors involved. The analysis suggests that for those organisations involved in London Thames Gateway there is a 'sense of a widely-held common project' (Amin and Thrift 1995) and that this is the 'institutional glue' that binds these organisations together. In this sense the study draws on anthropology by isolating typologies or generic characteristics to understand what binds (or not) these institutions together. The evidence also suggests that participation in developing an urban vision for London Thames Gateway has broadened to encompass sectors (such as the health sector) previously neglected in planning processes and this is a positive aspect of the reforms. In an analysis of the proposed Urban Development Corporation a number of positive (generic) components can be identified. However, the analysis also emphasises that the New Labour modernisation programme is likely to generate significant tensions and some of these are in evidence in London Thames Gateway. This is because the many changes and innovations that result from this programme are creating new institutional arrangements and there is evidence of competing cultures as emerging institutions bring with them a whole new set of values and rules-in-use. These new governance structures can be linked to London's position within the global economy, the 'flavour' of the new planning system and the spatial plans being produced to take account of these trends. The global economic race for economic competitiveness dictates that planners and planning must respond, whilst at the same time steering a course through social cohesion and environmental sustainability. It is argued that there is no spatial fait accompli and political institutions and civil society in London Thames Gateway are able to manoeuvre to steer these forces in a positive direction. And so, the broader of role of planners and their ability to deliver through these emerging institutional mechanisms is brought into question. In so doing we argue that this has forced them to cast aside traditional working practices and to develop new approaches to ensuring economic, environmental and social objectives are met through the prism of spatial planning.", "partners": "|Interview a -Greater London Authority (GLA)|Interview b \u2014Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) Interview c \u2014Mayor s Office|Interview d -Greater London Authority (GLA)|Interview e - Thames Gateway London Partnership (TGLP)", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "Anonymous Public Engagement", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "James Farrar"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The movement-image of the movement-machine", "short_title": "Deleuze, cinema and the London Underground", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Architecture", "abstract": "This thesis addresses the London Underground in the light of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of cinema. The first chapter gives an overview of the aspects of Deleuze's philosophy, which are of particular interest in the context of architectural theory. The main postulates of transcendental empiricism are explained, followed by the four major concepts: space, time, image and event. The second chapter deals with Deleuze's understanding of the cinematic frame. The relationship between the frame and the content of framing is shown as possibly inherently dynamic. A description of the major points regarding the Underground corridor follows, with the explanation of the condition of the walking body and its relation to the surrounds. Finally, the notion of the cinematic frame and acts of framing are utilised for the conceptualisation of the Underground corridor, showing the notion of movement to be of crucial importance. Chapter three regards the platform event in relation to the cinematic shot, which is explained to be a matter of conversion of movement. The specificity of the Underground platform is related, and the relationship between the body and the moving object of the train explained. The conjunction between the platform and the shot is then proposed, to show that the platform stands at a point of conversion of movement, transforming body's relationship to its environment. Chapter four is the discussion of the Underground carriage, and its understanding in the light of Deleuze's conceptualisation of the cinematic close-up. The close-up is shown to represent a specific, qualitative transformation, which marks the shift of movement in the direction of expression. The concept of any-space-whatever is then related as an example of Deleuze's transformation of the close-up of the face to the object and then to a spatial figure. The specifics of the Underground carriage are related, introducing the notion of the motionless body inside a moving confinement, as well as the presentation of 'facialisation.' The third part of the chapter sees the explanation of the carriage event in the light of the close-up/affection-image, and it pays special attention to the transformation of movement into expression. Finally, Chapter Five sees the discussion of the Underground in general, and its relation to the city. Deleuze's understanding of the concept of montage is explained in particular its relationship to time and construction of continuities and wholes across ruptures. The Underground is discussed as an urban system and its relation to the city that harbours it addressed. Finally, a particular understanding of urban montage is proposed, one wholly dependent on the presence of the Underground system.", "partners": "", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Marko Jobst"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Payments in lieu -- A mechanism for maximising affordable housing provision in London?", "short_title": "Maximising affordable housing provision", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning", "abstract": "This thesis explores the use of the planning system for providing affordable housing in London. It examines the way in which London borough councils have utilised the planning system in order to maximise affordable housing completions. It particular, it considers the way in which 'payments in lieu' (PiL) have contributed to the supply of affordable accommodation. This thesis assesses the planning policy framework for affordable housing provision in London. It also investigates past and current borough practices in respect of the implementation of these policies. This analysis includes an appraisal of the quantitative outputs of the planning system, including the particular contributions that have been forthcoming from PiL finances. The primary research for this thesis comprises a questionnaire survey of the thirty-three London boroughs and a number of case study planning applications involving PiL agreements. In addition, a range of secondary data sources are used in the analysis and evaluation, including Government 'Housing Investment Programme' (HIP) data. The findings of this thesis are considered in the light of the contemporary debate regarding the future of the system of planning obligations in the UK. The benefits and disadvantages of the current approach to seeking affordable housing provision through the planning system are evaluated within this wider context. This leads into an assessment of the various alternative policy approaches that could be adopted by the Government in relation to planning obligations, with particular reference to the issue of affordable housing contributions.", "partners": "Local officers", "funders": "", "partnership_types": "Anonymous Public Engagement", "data_source": "Discovery", "authors": "Jennifer Anne Hainsworth\u00a0"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Pedestrian demand modelling of large cities", "short_title": "Pedestrian demand modelling ", "kef_theme": "", "subject_area": "Planning and Policy", "output_type": "research", "department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis", "abstract": "This paper introduces a methodology for the development of city wide pedestrian demand models and shows its application to London.
