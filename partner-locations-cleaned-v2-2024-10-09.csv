It is plausible that these trends are contributing to regional accessibility inequalities, though quantitative research testing this link is limited. This paper examines differences in employment accessibility between Standard Occupational Classification groups in the London Metropolitan Region for 2011 for car, transit, bus only and walking modes. Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006–2016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits. Lower income groups are exposed to rent increases, though this is offset by social housing, which remains the most prevalent tenure in Inner London for low income classes.","1. Joana Barros

The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010–2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.","J.

Built in the 1950s to supply landmark social housing project Churchill Gardens, the district heating system sent heat from nearby Battersea power station into the radiators of the housing estate. The network is a rare example in the United Kingdom, where, unlike other European states, district heating did not become widespread. Today the heating system supplies more than 3,000 homes in the London Borough of Westminster, having survived the closure of the power station and the privatization of the housing estate it supplies. Therefore, this article argues, the neighborhood can be understood as a heterotopia, a site of an alternative sociotechnical order. This concept is used to understand the layers of economic, political, and technological rationalities that have supported PDHU and to question how it has survived radical changes in housing and energy policy in the United Kingdom. This lens allows us to see the tension between the urban planning and engineering perspective, which celebrates this system as a future-oriented “experiment,” and the reality of managing and using the system on the estate. The article analyzes this technology-enabled standard of living as a social contract between state and citizen, suggesting this is a way to analyze contemporary questions of district energy.","1.

Dry Bulb Temperature and Relative Humidity in the main living and sleeping area were monitored at 10 min intervals. The ASHRAE Standard 55 adaptive thermal comfort method was applied, which uses outdoor temperature to derive the optimum indoor comfort temperature. It was found that 29% of all living rooms and 31% of all bedrooms monitored during 2009 had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside the comfort zone recommended by the standard to achieve 90% acceptability. In 2010, 37% of monitored living rooms and 49% of monitored bedrooms had more than 1% of summertime occupied hours outside this comfort zone. The findings of this study indicate that London dwellings face a significant risk of overheating under the current climate.

Citizen participation rates are usually low, implying that they may feel this way too. There are two good reasons for this feeling: On the one hand, public consultation often only occurs when it is a mandatory exercise required by government for development approval; on the other, when public consultation occurs it is after much time and effort has been invested by professionals to develop a scheme therefore change is made reluctantly or not at all. These factors create a reactionary and adversarial atmosphere during consultation. These structural limitations mean that there is no time to find alignment of interests between project developers and the public, or to develop trust and collaborations. This article explores how codesign games as a form of public participation can be done at an early stage of project development to contribute to finding alignment of interests and collaborations between project developers and different public interests. The empirical case study is focussed on the possibilities for the retrofit of sustainable sanitation systems in London. Three future sanitation systems were developed by 14 workshop participants. They demonstrate new alignments of interests, from methods of collection and treatment, to new economies of reuse and production. It also established reasons why the current water-based sanitation systems are obdurate, and the work involved in keeping the status quo.","Centre for Codesign Research, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts",https://adk.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/center-for-codesign-research,https://adk.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/center-for-codesign-research,[],Co-Design,,,Co-Design,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,UCL Grand Challenges,,,REF 2021,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

The empirical enquiry takes place in the context of the delivery of London Heathrow Terminal 2. Through an inductive theory building approach drawing upon semi-structured interviews with client-side project leadership, internal documents, publicly available data and ongoing engagement with the field, we identified three key capability-enabling mechanisms that help explain the genesis of project capabilities in inter-organisational settings: (1) reconfiguring project capabilities, (2) adapting project capabilities and (3) maintaining project capabilities. We discuss and expand these findings by engaging with theoretical ideas from project studies, and mainstream strategy, organisation, and management research to induce a dynamic model that can be helpful to guide future research, policy and management practices relating to the client side management of project capabilities.","Phil Wilbraham

Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nat- ure of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demon- strate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning – being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research.","Addison Lee Limited

The SDGs challenge the dominant notion of prosperity as material wealth measured by GDP and rising household incomes; instead prosperity is reframed as a shared condition to be weighed alongside ending poverty, tackling inequalities and safeguarding the environment. Cities are identified as having a critical role in generating and equitably distributing prosperity on these terms. Reframing prosperity in this way opens up space for new forms of dialogue about what it means for people everywhere to prosper, asking how material wealth and other forms of value, equity and fairness, and the needs of humans and non-humans are differentially understood and acted on. Yet this article argues that prosperity is under-studied and under-theorized by social scientists. A new research agenda, driven by empirical studies in diverse urban contexts, must form the basis for new theoretical insights and policy formation that will drive action on prosperity in the years to come. Presenting new empirical work from community-led research in three east London neighbourhoods, the article examines prosperity as a lived experience in comparison to policy goal; demonstrating how context-specific meanings and practices challenge the orthodox models and metrics that currently dominate policymaking.

Then, in 2002, the UK government introduced a new progressive beer duty tax which enabled small-scale brewers to brew beer while paying less tax than their larger competitors, thus levelling the uneven financial playing field that economies of scale had created. This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made.

The assessments in many cases do not include the overall carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of different regeneration scenarios. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the methodology used to calculate the environmental impacts over the lifecycle of buildings. The current practice of building LCA is regularly conducted less effectively, and the uncertainties such as the limited scope of the framework and the variable system boundaries can produce considerably contrasting outcomes which can also be interpreted subjectively. This paper aims to explore a participatory approach to conducting LCA for options appraisal of estate regeneration schemes. The study employs a mixed methods design consisting of primary and secondary data collection and rapid ethnographic observations. The research includes a case study of a Housing Estate in London under threat of demolition. The community’s refurbishment and extension proposal has been developed through knowledge mobility and co-design workshops with the members of the community and University College London (UCL) design team, who are the stakeholders involved in conducting the participatory LCA. LCA of different regeneration and redevelopment scenarios have been explored. The results of the research provide convincing evidence in favour of the refurbishment scenarios over the redevelopment scenario. The findings can make a case for a participatory assessment framework for the evaluation of estate regeneration schemes and highlight the necessity of including other aspects beyond CO2 emissions in the assessment criteria.

The range of impacts in the actual scenario varied from no effect on task execution, to disruption, distraction, concern of disturbing others or being heard. Positive impacts included support of concentration, relaxation, motivation, freedom of sound expression, feeling of being connected to the surroundings and comforted by the presence of others, according to mechanisms described in the study. Negative appraisal could trigger coping strategies (e.g., controlling windows, playing music, wearing headphones) and behavioural changes (e.g., lowering the volume of the voice or music, muting oneself during call, changing workout type) that could in turn limit or enhance the freedom of behaviour, affect or foster wellbeing. Negative impacts were most frequently reported on WFH (by 55% of the participants), followed by relaxation activities (40.6%), sexual activities (30.1%), and home workout (20.1%). The ideal soundscape was described as a quiet, well-sound insulated environment, which guarantees access to positive sounds (i.e., natural sounds, music, urban background), thus resulting in privacy, intimacy, and a place where to express themselves without noise-related constraints. The study complements literature findings on housing design directions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing further evidence on the impacts of poor sound insulation at home, the potential benefits of nature-based solutions for positive indoor soundscapes, and opportunities for an activity-based design of domestic environments, inclusive of a broader set of home uses and household compositions.","1.

It further explores the potential of passive adaptations to improve indoor environmental conditions. Temperature and relative humidity data from continuous monitoring during summer 2019 were used to calibrate a building performance simulation model of the care home. Simulation outputs from two bedrooms and two lounges under the current (2019) and future climate (2080s with 90th percentile probability, high-emissions scenario under the UK Climate Projections 2009) were analyzed to evaluate the risk of indoor overheating and humidity discomfort, and to test the effectiveness of adaptation scenarios related to window operation and external shading. Results showed a high risk of exposure to high indoor temperature and low humidity under the current climate, which are expected to worsen in the future. Regarding the effect of passive adaptations, it was found that the highest potential decline in overheating and dry air incidence could be achieved through a combination of secured window opening at night and closing of external shutters during the day; yet this was compromised by an increased risk of humid air. Results further indicated that these strategies are not adequate under a future high-emissions climate scenario, which suggests that care homes need to combine passive and active ventilation to maintain indoor environmental comfort and reduce anticipated cooling demand.","1.

Lenders were reassured by the Corporation’s reputation, and its borrowing was partly secured by future coal tax receipts. The records show that funding from these sources was forthcoming and would have covered the costs.

To achieve significant emission reductions in an economically viable way, this study uses Life Cycle Performance approaches to carry a cross-comparison between the refurbishment and replacement of two housing archetypes in London: mid-terrace-house and a bungalow. Specifically, the study integrates Life Cycle Carbon Footprint (LCCF) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) protocols (EN 15978:2011 and BS ISO 15686–5), thermal simulations (EnergyPlus), building generative design framework (PLOOTO - Parametric Lay-Out Organisation generator) and mathematical optimisation algorithms (NSGA-II). Results show that the optimal refurbishment archetypes generally performed better than replacements (Refurbishments LCCF ranges between 1,100 and 1,500 kgCO2e/m2 and LCC 440-680 £/m2, compared to that of the replacements scenarios, ranging 1,220-1,850 kgCO2e/m2 and 550-890 £/m2).

As generators of governance innovation and indicators of the future city in each urban context, large-scale development projects have been interpreted within frameworks of “variegations” of wider circulating processes, such as neoliberalisation or financialisation. However, such projects often entail significant state support and investment, are strongly linked to a wide variety of transnational investors and developers and are frequently highly contested in their local environments. Thus, each project comes to fruition in a distinctive regulatory context, often as an exception to the norm, and each emerges through complex interactions over a long period of time amongst an array of actors. We therefore seek to broaden the discussion from an analytical focus on variegated globalised processes to consider three large-scale urban development projects (in Shanghai, Johannesburg and London) as distinctive (transcalar) territorialisations. Using an innovative comparative approach we outline the grounds for a systematic analytical conversation across mega-urban development projects in very different contexts. Initially, comparability rests on the shared features of large-scale developments – that they are multi-jurisdictional, involve long time scales, and bring significant financing challenges. Comparing three development projects we are able to interrogate, rather than take for granted, how wider processes, circulating practices, transcalar actors, and territorial regulatory formations composed specific urban outcomes in each case. Thinking across these diverse cases provides grounds for rebuilding understandings of urban development politics.","1. London Tenants’ Federation

Following 40 years of privatisation, these council-owned companies have been celebrated as a post-neoliberal municipal alternative to the hegemony of market-led urban policy. By developing commodified real estate and monetising rising land values, they promise to deliver well-designed housing, generate long-term fiscal rents, and secure local state autonomy. Drawing on in-depth empirical research, this paper develops a situated political economic critique of the limitations, contradictions, and risks of local housing companies in London. Framed as a “critical case”, providing insight into the politics of speculative urban provisioning and land value extraction, I argue that local housing companies represent a mode of municipal statecraft—a local state rentierism—that leans into and reproduces a political economy of financialisation and rentierism with potentially long-term implications for collective urban provisioning.","1.

Yet, despite the proliferation of studies investigating accessibility and equity from the perspective of the younger generation, only modest progress has been made in embedding a temporal perspective and targeting health services for older adults. Currently, the number of people over 60s in London is growing rapidly and is projected to increase to approximately two million by 2035. Aims: This research aims to examine walking accessibility to General Practitioners (GPs) for older people in Greater London, with a particular focus from a temporal perspective. Methods: Three different datasets were used for this study, namely: GP services data and data on GP Opening Times data from NHS Choices; the London Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) atlas; and the road network derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study uses on the cumulative method to calculate accessibility to GPs – and applies the vertical equity index to measure temporal equity. Results: Our results show that opening times have a significant impact on accessibility to health services for older people in London. Overall accessibility peaked at midday when 15.88% of areas have a low degree of accessibility. Additionally, our study classifies local authorities into five groups based on their performance on accessibility and vertical equity measurements. We found several districts with inadequate and unequal accessibility that can be identified as vulnerable areas. Conclusions: Gaining insights into the temporal variations in accessibility to GPs represents a key step towards providing optimal services. Our findings can be used to provide an evidence-based reference for transport planners and policymakers to promote age-friendly development and planning.",Menggiu Cao,"School of Architecture and Cities, University of Westminster, United Kingdom (51.522023,-0.154599)",University of Westminster,"[(51.522023,-0.154599)]",Co-authorship with academic partner(s),,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Health,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),National Social Science Fund of China (NSSFC),,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

Data sources include interviews with Estate Managers, others involved in, or affected by their management, and other corporate public information. Our theoretical framing draws on performativity theory that we see as a valuable addition to existing research approaches. We describe and analyse the ways these agencies construct narratives and practices of socially responsible and historically established forms of performance, that they label ‘place-stewardship’, and the specific mechanisms they use to bring places into existence. Collectively, the discussion calls for an increased focus on how models abstracted from local context and politics can be ‘localised’, in the study of the governance of the built environment.

There is also evidence on the role played by blue and green space in improving physical and mental health, reducing the burden on the health care service. Yet from an urban planning and development view, natural capital may be considered a nice to have, but not essential element of urban design; taking up valuable space which could otherwise be used for traditional built environment uses. While urban natural capital is largely recognised as a positive element, its benefits are difficult to measure both in space and time, making its inclusion in urban (re)development difficult to justify. Here, using a London case study and information provided by key stakeholders, we present a system dynamics (SD) modelling framework to assess the natural capital performance of development and aid design evaluation. A headline indicator: Natural Space Performance, is used to evaluate the capacity of natural space to provide ecosystem services, providing a semi-quantitative measure of system wide impacts of change within a combined natural, built and social system. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life. Furthermore, the application of a SD approach captures key interactions between variables over time, showing system evolution while highlighting intervention opportunities.","Jimmy O'Keeffe

Using a discrete number of plan forms selected from case studies, a virtual risk database was populated with the results of a large number of parametric dynamic thermal simulations based on the EnergyPlus calculation engine and including aspects such as location within Greater London, orientation, fenestration size and natural ventilation, which are associated with known overheating risk factors. Alternative statistical meta-models were developed with both explanatory and predictive purposes, correlating the simulation input with the overheating risk predictions expressed according to multiple metrics. Results from multiple linear regression analysis show that while all factors considered are relevant towards determining the propensity to overheating, window opening and natural ventilation capacity are by far the strongest predictors among those considered. The implementation of machine learning algorithms is shown to improve the accuracy of the meta-model, producing very high coefficients of determination (R2) and lower prediction errors (RMSE). The development of a meta-model demonstrates the ability of returning accurate predictions with limited input, albeit with significant limitations. Possibilities of further improvements to the tool are briefly outlined, including the coupling with a User Interface for applicability in a design environment for early-stage design advice.","PRP

Perceived affective quality of indoor soundscapes has been assessed in the survey through a previously developed model, as the combination of two perceptual dimensions, one related to comfort (a comfortable – annoying continuum) and the other to content (a full of content – empty continuum). Part I of the study reported on differences in comfort, content, and soundscape appropriateness based on the activity performed at home during the lockdown, i.e. working from home (WFH) and relaxation. Moreover, associations between soundscape dimensions and psychological well-being have been highlighted. Part II of the study deals with the exploration of the influences of several acoustical, building, urban and person-related factors on soundscape dimensions and well-being. A mixed-method approach has been adopted by combining multivariate regression of questionnaire scores with the qualitative analysis of spontaneous descriptions given by respondents. Results showed that several sound sources, urban features, housing characteristics, working modes and demographic factors can influence (positively and negatively) soundscape dimensions differently depending on the task at hand. Notably, the perceived dominance of neighbours’ noises during relaxation, moderated by noise sensitivity, and the number of people at home were common factors negatively affecting both comfort and well-being, that partially explained the association between comfortable indoor soundscapes and better mental health. The discussion points out the importance of considering the different impacts that acoustical factors (e.g. sound typology), building (e.g., house size), urban (e.g., availability of a quiet side), situational (e.g., number of people at home), and person-related factors (e.g., noise sensitivity) can provide on building occupants depending on the specific activity people are engaged with at home and the opportunities to foster people’s well-being through building, urban and acoustic design.",Adult participants via Prolific participant pool,London,London,[],Data / questionnaire / method,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Health,Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE),European Research Council (ERC),,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

Recent models of hierarchical route planning use boundaries to plan efficiently first across regions and then within regions. However, it remains unclear which structures (e.g. parks, rivers, major streets, etc.) will form salient boundaries in real-world cities. This study tested licensed London taxi drivers, who are unique in their ability to navigate London flexibly without physical navigation aids. They were asked to indicate streets they considered as boundaries for London districts or dividing areas. It was found that agreement on boundary streets varied considerably, from some boundaries providing almost no consensus to some boundaries consistently noted as boundaries. Examining the properties of the streets revealed that a key factor in the consistent boundaries was the near rectilinear nature of the designated region (e.g. Mayfair and Soho) and the distinctiveness of parks (e.g. Regent's Park). Surprisingly, the River Thames was not consistently considered as a boundary. These findings provide insight into types of environmental features that lead to the perception of explicit boundaries in large-scale urban space. Because route planning models assume that boundaries are used to segregate the space for efficient planning, these results help make predictions of the likely planning demands of different routes in such complex large-scale street networks. Such predictions could be used to highlight information used for navigation guidance applications to enable more efficient hierarchical planning and learning of large-scale environments.",Jeremy Morley,"

This paper examines the current and future risk of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings. Continuous monitoring of outdoor and indoor temperature in bedrooms, communal areas and offices in summer 2019 helped to establish the prevalence and intensity of overheating. Dynamic thermal simulation (EnergyPlusV8.9) of the two care settings assessed the potential for avoiding active cooling in future climate using passive solutions. In both care settings, indoor temperatures were observed to exceed 30 °C during daytime hours, significantly higher than the recommended 26 °C threshold of Public Health England. Although severity of overheating was lower in the older building, overheating was found to be prevalent and prolonged across both care settings with bedroom temperatures higher than lounges especially at night. Thermal simulation analysis showed that, with regards to temperature reduction and cooling load, nighttime ventilation was the single most effective passive solution for both buildings for the current climate, while a combination of night ventilation, external shading and high-albedo external walls was the most effective package solution. By the 2080s, air-conditioning was the most effective solution for reducing temperature, but also had the highest cooling load, highlighting the importance of balancing passive with active measures to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads.",Paul Wilkinson ,"Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK

To this end, one-year’s worth of monitored data on indoor and outdoor environment along with occupant use of windows has been used to analyse the impact of lockdown on IAQ. Moreover, using on-site CO2 data, monitored occupancy and operation of windows, the team has calibrated a thermal performance model of one of the flats to investigate the implications of alternative ventilation strategies. The results suggest that despite the extended occupancy during lockdown, occupants relied less on natural ventilation, which led to significantly higher CO2 and PM10 concentrations.

Concurrent energy efficiency improvements to housing may modify indoor exposures to heat or cold, while population aging may increase susceptibility to temperature-related mortality. We estimate heat and cold mortality and energy consumption in London for typical (non-extreme) future climates, given projected changes in population and housing. Building physics models are used to simulate summertime and wintertime indoor temperatures and space heating energy consumption of London dwellings for ‘baseline’ (2005-2014) and future (2030s, 2050s) periods using data from the English Housing Survey, historical weather data, and projected future weather data with temperatures representative of ‘typical’ years. Linking to population projections, we calculate future heat and cold attributable mortality and energy consumption with demolition, construction, and alternative scenarios of energy efficiency retrofit. At current retrofit rates, around 168-174 annual cold-related deaths per million population would typically be avoided by the 2050s, or 261-269 deaths per million under ambitious retrofit rates. Annual heat deaths would typically increase by 1 per million per year under the current retrofit rate, and 12-13 per million under ambitious rates without population adaptation to heat. During typical future summers, an estimated 38-73% of heat-related deaths can be avoided using external shutters on windows, with their effectiveness lower for hotter summers. Despite warmer winters, ambitious retrofit rates are necessary to reduce typical annual energy consumption for heating below baseline levels, assuming no improvement in heating system efficiencies. Concerns over future overheating in energy efficient housing are valid but increases in heat attributable mortality during typical and hot (but not extreme) summers are more than offset by significant reductions in cold mortality and easily mitigated using passive measures. More ambitious retrofit rates are critical to reduce energy consumption and offer co-benefits for reducing cold-related mortality.",Paul Wilkinson,"Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK

However, there is a general lack of evidence-based studies investigating the relative network roles of rail stations. Therefore, this paper aims to explore rail stations' roles within and beyond metropolitan communities in London. Drawing on the Transport for London's newly released NUMBAT passenger origin-destination data, we unravel the travel structure and identify the stations' roles through network methods, community detection and Z-P scores. Our research has three results: First, London's passenger movement network can be subdivided into seven communities. The majority of stations within the same communities are geographically localised with few exceptions. Second, stations play distinct roles in handling the patterns of movement at different scales. Typically, there exists a set of stations that are significant for connecting between metropolitan communities, because the disruption of those stations will have a greater impact on overall network efficiency and affect a larger and more diverse group of passengers. Third, a classification of rail stations is developed based on stations' commitment at two scales. This classification allows planners to have a finer level of understanding of the network role of the stations and thus develop and adjust tailored (re)development strategies.",Ed Manley,"The Alan Turing Institute, United Kingdom (51.529985,-0.127014)",The Alan Turing Institute,"[(51.529985,-0.127014)]",Co-authorship with research organization(s),,,Co-authorship with research organization(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Construction and Engineering ,,,,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time–activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.","Sani Dimitroulopoulou Environmental Hazards and Emergencies Department, Public Health England United Kingdom","(51.5045224, -0.0221204)",Public Health England,"[(51.5045224, -0.0221204)]",Co-authorship with government partner(s),"Government

To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels.","Menggiu Cao

The relationship between home energy-efficiency and occupant health and wellbeing remains an area of ongoing research. This paper explores the nexus between home energy efficiency, energy consumption and self-reported health-an indicator of the general health and wellbeing of the population. We focus on Greater London through secondary data analysis. Energy-efficiency ratings and air infiltration rates of dwellings, derived from EPCs, were aggregated and matched to local area self-reported health and energy consumption data obtained from the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) Atlas database. Our regression model indicates that improving the energy efficiency (SAP) rating by 10 points for a typical home may reduce household gas consumption by around 7% (95% CIs: 2%, 14%). Beta regression finds a positive, but not statistically significant association between median SAP rating and the proportion of the population reporting 'good or very good' health when considering all Greater London LSOAs (z score = 0.60, p value = 0.55). A statistically significant positive association is observed however when repeating the analysis for the lowest income quartile LSOAs (z score = 2.03, p value = 0.04). This indicates that the least well-off may benefit most from home energy efficiency programs. A statistically significant positive association is also observed for the relationship between self-reported health and air infiltration rates (z score = 2.62, p value = 0.01). The findings support existing evidence for the predominantly naturally ventilated UK housing stock, suggesting that home energy efficiency measures provide a co-benefit for occupant health provided that adequate air exchange is maintained.",Greater London Authority’s (GLA) ,"51.507495,0.016223",Greater London Authority,"[(51.507495,0.016223)]",Database,Government,The UK Government,Data Support ,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Health,Wellcome Trust ,,,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2% of all properties in London, and up to 7% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.",Zahratu Shabrina ,"King’s College London (51.511612,-0.116253)",King's College London,"[(51.511612,-0.116253)]",Co-authorship with academic partner(s),"Aggregator

Little is currently understood about the collective transport impacts of such activity in urban centres and to what extent this poses challenges for transport policymakers. The paper provides an international review of market growth in this sector together with insight into key topics associated with its freight delivery operations in urban areas. Using a substantial database of meal deliveries made in London by a major platform provider, this paper quantifies the operational performance of these deliveries and their transport and environmental impacts. On average, 9.6 deliveries were undertaken by a DD daily, with each taking 25 min from pickup to delivery with an average trip length, from restaurant to customer of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) a DD travelling 41.3 km (25.7 miles) in total per day, The analysis of the case study indicates the relative transport inefficiency of these on-demand meal deliveries compared to other forms of urban road freight (with a meal delivered by car being responsible for approximately 1300 times the distance travelled by an articulated HGV operation per tonne delivered). It also highlights the far greater GHG emissions and transport intensity associated with meals deliveries by cars and petrol mopeds compared to bicycles (emitting 5 and 11 times more GHGs per meal delivered than bicycles, respectively). The transport and GHG emissions intensity of these meal deliveries raises important policy issues, especially given therapid growth in the provision of, and demand for, these services internationally, Based on the review and analysis, the paper provides a discussion of the key issues that urban policymakers around the world need to take account of in relation to this fast-growing sector including vehicle fuel sources, road safety, trip generation rates and their impacts on local residents, together with recommended actions.","Julian Allen

It undertakes feasibility work to identify possible causes of overheating across a range of care home types and evaluate the current and future potential of indicative passive solutions. The summertime thermal environments of five case study care homes were monitored and their physical, technical and occupancy profiles were established through surveys. The data was inputed in the EnergyPlus V8.9 dynamic thermal simulations via the DesignBuilder Graphical User Interface. Future overheating risks and their reduction potential through the use of passive strategies were tested under a set of representative climate change scenarios, during a five-day heatwave period. The dynamic thermal simulation analysis indicated that older buildings with higher heat loss and thermal mass capacities are likely to benefit more from the application of high albedo materials rather than external shading methods, whereas newer and highly insulated buildings seem to benefit more from higher ventilation rates and appropriate external shading systems. Night ventilation emerged as the single most impactful passive technique for all building types. This feasibility work has developed novel methods, knowledge and insights that will be helpful in understanding how to enable care settings in the UK to become resilient to rising heat stress. This is one of the first systematic attempts to build a set of dynamic thermal models of care homes in the UK.","1. Paul Wilkinson

Young people are typically less involved in research about their prosperity than adults. Their views and experiences are therefore less likely to be considered in policy decisions than adults’. However, young people – and particularly adolescents between 14-24 years old – are significantly affected by societal transformation, and are capable of reflecting on and responding to that transformation. We outline a study conducted with young people in Hackney who are mostly in mid-adolescence (between 14-17 years old). Hackney is a borough in east London which has undergone significant social and economic transformation. We draw out the main factors which young people said influenced their ability to live a good life in Hackney and discuss their views of the London Prosperity Index. We argue that there are structural differences and value differences which affect how young people understand prosperity, and which impact their capacity to lead a good life in places which are changing significantly. We conclude by establishing the need for a Youth Prosperity Index, to complement the Prosperity Index and related indexes, which focus on adults’ experiences and values.

This history leads to an account of the development, since 2009, of the 3DStock method for modelling complete building stocks, both domestic and non-domestic. The paper explains how 3DStock models are built and the data sources used. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship of premises (the floorspace occupied by organisations) to buildings. Energy use may be metered at the level of premises, buildings or groups of buildings. Representing the patterns in which premises relate to buildings is therefore crucial to the modelling process, and in particular to the precise measurement of energy intensities. Applications of 3DStock models in building science and policy tools are reviewed, including the London Building Stock Model (LBSM), delivered to the Greater London Authority (GLA) in 2020. This ‘digital twin’ can be used for the monitoring, simulation and analysis of the building stock. Implications for research and policy are discussed, particularly for energy epidemiology, density, high-rise buildings, retrofit potential, energy-use intensity and benchmarking. Data are in place to extend 3DStock modelling to the whole of England and Wales. / Policy and practice relevance: The models can be used to assess energy demand in large numbers of buildings in relation to a range of variables, including built form, age, construction and activities. Poorly performing buildings can be identified, and the potential for retrofit—including renewable technology installations—evaluated using the same variables plus information contained in Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). Policies for addressing fuel poverty can be evaluated by making links to confidential socioeconomic data on occupants. In conjunction with a dynamic building energy-simulation tool, scenarios can be investigated for retrofit, the potential for renewables and issues in demand-side management. Additional uses are in the precise measurements of density and of the three-dimensional character of the urban fabric. There could be applications in public health, the modelling of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and the tracking of material flows. 3DStock models might also be integrated with digital twins of infrastructure systems and networks.",Agnieszka Griffin at the Greater London Authority (GLA),"51.507495,0.016223",Greater London Authority,"[(51.507495,0.016223)]",,"Think tank

We conducted this research at local authority level rather than region level to offer a clearer insight into the relationship between house price variation and travel time to London, concentrating especially on the period post the 2008 financial crisis. Results show that local authorities with shorter travel tomes to London generally have greater house prices increases, but with some exceptions. The majority of local authorities within 75 minutes travel time to London had a high house price increase between 2009 and 2016.

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. METHODS: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007–2016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). RESULTS: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036–1.043 per 1 °C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026–1.039 and 1.043, 1.037–1.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an important contribution towards informing city-level climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","Peninah Murage

Consequently, the UK government announced its intention to ban diesel vehicles by 2040 to achieve a sustainable zero-carbon road transport system. Since no empirical studies have used a bottom-up approach to seek Londoners’ views, it is therefore worth investigating the public opinion regarding this forthcoming ban. This paper aims to fill this research gap by taking London as a case study. A survey was designed, and fieldwork was conducted to distribute questionnaires to Londoners. Completed questionnaires were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings revealed that the majority of Londoners would be in favour of the ban if they were sufficiently exposed to the appropriate sources of information and were favourably disposed towards environmental protection measures. The results also showed that Londoners were more likely to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) if they were offered generous incentives and encouraged to use scrappage schemes. The present study makes a strong case for enforcing the ban well before 2040.

However, most recent research has focused on the environmental and economic aspects of developing sustainable urban environment, whilst largely neglecting the social aspects. Contemporary political thinking in the UK often disregards the potential of the urban infrastructure to improve social equity. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of transport infrastructure on a variety of social measures, in an empirical and ideologically unbiased fashion, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We selected “Tramlink” as a case study: a light-rail system in the London Borough of Croydon which began operation in 2000. We used quantitative methods, including advanced spatial statistics, to produce a more detailed analysis of social equity than has been previously published. This acknowledges that determining localised issues can produce more informed and effective policy interventions. Our results demonstrate that the physical properties of transport infrastructure and the non-physical attributes of society, in combination, help to create opportunities for individuals to succeed. We also find that in order to reduce the negative effects of austerity, public money could be more effectively spent if diverted to areas that are most in need which can be highlighted through localised investigations.","Mengqiu Cao

The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers issued Technical Memorandum 59 (TM59) with the aim of achieving consistency in the modelling processes followed for the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. However, as each tool’s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus influence the overheating risk assessment in flats, while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications. Practical application: Technical Memorandum 59 issued by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers may be widely adopted within the industry to assist the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. This work suggests that the choice of building performance simulation tool can greatly influence the predicted overheating risk. Furthermore, the differences identified in the modelling of heat transfer processes could also impact other modelling applications. Following these results, the need for detailed empirical validation studies of naturally ventilated homes has been highlighted.","Anastasia Mylona

This perhaps reﬂects the heightened levels of social inequity in cities and the concern over diﬀerential access to transport and participation in activities. This paper considers these issues by applying the Capabilities Approach to transport, in order to examine an individual’s opportunities to travel and engage in activities (capabilities) and their actual day to day travel and engagement in activities (functionings). London is selected as a case study using analysis from three Underground stations on the Jubilee Line Extension. The ﬁndings show that there are statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, and also across diﬀerent neighbourhoods in London. It is argued that unless local residents’ potential travel opportunities and actual activities, and the gaps between them, are better understood and responded to, the problem of transport-related social inequity is likely to persist in London. Therefore, we suggest that the ﬁndings from this research, including the multi-dimensional social indicators and understanding of the barriers to accessibility, could be used alongside existing approaches such as accessibility planning.","Mengqui Cao

This paper describes a two-level parcel distribution model that combines walking and driving for a single driver. The model aims to minimise the total travelling time by scheduling a vehicle’s routing and the driver’s walking sequence when making deliveries, taking decisions on parking locations into consideration. The model is a variant of the Clustered Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows, in which the sequence of visits within each cluster is required to form a closed tour. When applied to a case study of an actual vehicle round from a parcel carrier operating in London, savings of over 20% in the total operation time were returned over the current situation where 144 parcels were being delivered to 57 delivery locations.","Julian Allen

This paper focusses on this problem of measurement and reports on the findings from a rigorous testing scheme carried out to quantify air and surface mould concentrations and particle counts within 71 rooms from 64 properties in North London, some with and some without visible mould. The aim was to investigate the potential of passive and active air sampling strategies (sampling from still and actively mixed air, respectively) to explain visible mould, and understand how home/room characteristics correlate with the obtained readings. Airborne mould levels were quantified using an Andersen sampler (passively and actively), as well as by a chemical method based on the quantification of the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity (actively), which was also used to quantify surface mould. The mould levels were then correlated against physical characteristics of the tested homes/rooms, collected by means of survey sheets developed as part of this study. The findings did not reveal any independent variable governing all or most of the response variables, but a complex analysis suggested that whether it is a house or a flat could depict mould levels in the air and on the surfaces. It was also shown that a robust testing protocol should combine air and surface based methods, and an active air sampling strategy leads to a more accurate appraisal of airborne mould levels. Finally, the results showed that while there is some correlation between visible mould (and other moisture induced problems such as condensation) and measured air mould concentrations, lack of visible mould within a room does not necessarily mean low air mould concentrations, and thus one should not rely solely on visual inspection.","Hector Altamirano

",Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"Knowledge discovery about people and cities from emerging location data has been an active research field but is still relatively unexplored. In recent years, a considerable amount of work has been developed around the use of social media data, most of which focusses on mining the content, with comparatively less attention given to the location information. Furthermore, what aggregated scale spatial patterns show still needs extensive discussion. This paper proposes a tweet-topic-function-structure framework to reveal spatial patterns from individual tweets at aggregated spatial levels, combining an unsupervised learning algorithm with spatial measures. Two-year geo-tweets collected in Greater London were analyzed as a demonstrator of the framework and as a case study. The results indicate, at a disaggregated level, that the distribution of topics possess a fair degree of spatial randomness related to tweeting behavior. When aggregating tweets by zones, the areas with the same topics form spatial clusters but of entangled urban functions. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering generates a clear spatial structure with orders of centers. Our work demonstrates that although uncertainties exist, geo-tweets should still be a useful resource for informing spatial planning, especially for the strategic planning of economic clusters.",Chen Zhong,"Department of Geography, King's College London, WC2R 2LS, UK (51.51323921810703, -0.11708640373538458)",King's College London,"[(51.51323921810703, -0.11708640373538458)]",Co-authorship with academic partner(s),,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Planning and Policy,Tsinghua University Open Fund ,,,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

Using data sourced from the Oyster smart card and Twitter, we perform a time-series cluster analysis, exploring the similarity of temporal trends amongst places assigned to each cluster.

In response to an intensifying housing crisis and austerity-imposed fiscal constraints, municipalities in London are devising entrepreneurial solutions to deliver more housing. Among these ‘solutions’ can be found the early signs of the state-executed financialization of public housing in the UK with the use of speculative council-owned special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that replace existing public housing stock with mixed-tenure developments, creating ambiguous public/private tenancies that function as homes and the basis for liquid financial assets. Drawing together parallel literatures on the financialization of urban governance and housing, and combining these with original empirical research, we situate these developments in contrast to earlier modes of governance, identifying a distinct mode of entrepreneurial governance in London: financialized municipal entrepreneurialism.

This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.","J.

This phenomenon is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI), and this paper introduces a methodology to investigate the spatial variability of air and surface temperatures across London. In particular, this study aims to investigate if a widely used spatial resolution (1 km) is appropriate for heat-related health risk studies. Data from vehicle-transect and ASTER thermal images were overlaid on a reference grid of 1 km, used by UHI simulation models. The results showed higher variability of air temperature within some specific modelled grid cells in the city centre, while surface temperatures presented higher variability in the London borders.

This paper presents a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis of energy conservation measures for a planned large, medium-rise office building in central London, UK with Gross Floor Area of 15,590 m2 and a 60-year building lifetime. The original design complied with the UK Building Regulations Part L, achieving 40% operational carbon emission savings compared to Target Emissions Rate. The LCA solutions focused on structure, envelope, and operational systems. Embodied energy saving strategies encompassed the application of lean design principles and integration of low carbon materials. Operational energy saving techniques included the adoption of a fabric-first approach, adaptive thermal conditions and sustainable building systems. Cumulatively, these optimization strategies achieved a maximum of 16% and 13% savings on life cycle carbon and energy, respectively, compared to the original design. Embodied strategies saved 32% and 9% on embodied carbon and energy, respectively, while operational strategies reduced the original consumption by 14% on both indicators. Over a 60-year building lifetime, operational energy was 10 times higher than embodied energy, while operational carbon was 8 times higher than embodied carbon. The study findings have highlighted the significance of LCA for early stage building design decisions.","Meike Borchers

School of Architecture and Allied Arts, University of Oregon. Portland, U.S.",Bartlett School of Architecture,"Small businesses in the same sector tend to be geographically concentrated. Understanding why businesses in some industries cluster is a key issue in urban economic theory, particularly in the Marshallian and Jacobsian traditions. These emphasize the logistical and informational synergies (advantages) that accrue to firms in agglomeration economies, allowing firms located near one another to accelerate their rate of innovation. However, little is known about how spatial forms foster the clustering of firms or the mechanisms through which this process might facilitate knowledge spillover over between different businesses. In this paper we present an historical case study in which space syntax methods, archival research and urban economic theory were used to enhance understanding of the spatial ordering of London's nineteenth-and early twentieth-century furniture industry, a sector characterised by a proliferation of small, local firms. The spatial morphologies of the furniture industry in the Shoreditch and Fitzrovia areas of London are profiled by linking business directories, historical Ordnance Survey maps and Goad fire insurance plans to space syntax measures describing the spatial configuration of London's street network, on a GIS platform. Historically, the two casestudy areas have hosted a wide range of furniture-manufacturing businesses. We hypothesise that the contrast between the spatial structures of the two districts contributed to the divergent paths development of the furniture industry in these places. Our results suggest the two areas developed as different knowledge economies, in part as a consequence of their contrasting spatial configurations and their influence on industrial organization. Shoreditch became a 'specialization' economy (i.e. Marshallian). Here the organic pattern of streets allowed specialized businesses to be located in close proximity to key streets, benefiting from more local footfall, and in close localization of firms belonging to the same industry. Fitzrovia, however, showed a more 'diversified' economy (i.e. Jacobsian), accommodating most of its retailers on streets highly integrated across scales and more commercially-driven. In the context of constraints of land use and rising land values, manufacturing operations moved to other places whilst retaining large-size firms that created a retail destination in a high footfall location good for attracting passing trade. We anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the distinctive spatial cultures of urban manufacturing and to the development of a methodological approach that opens up new prospects for inter-disciplinary research.",Laura Narvaez Zertuche,"Urban Design Group, Foster + Partners Ltd.

Giacomo Vecia",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"The concept of 'sustainable travel' has been well discussed for over three decades; yet the meaning of sustainability in travel remains interpreted in many different ways. A transition to more environmentally sustainable travel has proved difficult to achieve, particularly in suburban areas. For individuals in society there are many different aspirations for, and constraints on, travelling in an environmentally sustainable manner. Lack of modal choice, route options, the cost of using public transport, and wider cultural norms are a few of the barriers to realizing a more sustainable transport network. Compounding this is the 'last mile' problem, concerning the facilities linking the main mode to the home, workplace or wider destination, which are often poor. This paper explores both the perceptions and opinions of everyday commuters in Ealing, London, including consideration of their localized lastmile issues. An in-depth study is undertaken with thirty-five employees of Ealing Council, using Q methodology to investigate the participants' perceptions towards, and awareness of, their respective journeys. The Q method analysis undertaken highlighted four major discourses associated with travel and the last mile problem in Ealing: 'the public transport user', 'the committed cyclist', 'the multi-modal traveller' and 'the frustrated traveller'. Understanding these different discourses and their unique characteristics has significant potential for assisting policy-makers and planners in developing more targeted investment priorities, policies, and stakeholder engagement strategies.",Ealing Council,"14 Uxbridge Rd, London W5 2HL (51.513207002689924, -0.3076413453114308)",Ealing Council,"[(51.513207002689924, -0.3076413453114308)]",Research participation,,,Public Engagement ,,,,Sustainability ,,,,Discovery,,['Ealing'],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": [[-0.308548, 51.512653]]}, ""properties"": {}}"

For comparison and to estimate exposure misclassification we compared Londoners LHEM exposure with exposure at the residential address, a commonly used exposure metric in epidemiological research. In 2011, the mean annual LHEM exposure to outdoor sources was estimated to be 37% lower for PM2.5 and 63% lower for NO2 than at the residential address. These decreased estimates reflect the effects of reduced exposure indoors, the amount of time spent indoors (∼95%), and the mode and duration of travel in London. We find that an individual’s exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 outside their residential address is highly correlated (Pearson’s R of 0.9).

Using environmental and health data collected in primary schools in London, this study estimates that, on average, 82 asthma exacerbations per school can be averted each year by reducing outdoor NO2 concentrations. The study expands upon previous analyses in two ways: first it assesses the health benefits of reducing children’s exposure to indoor NO2 while at school, second it considers the children’s perspective in the economic evaluation. Using a willingness to pay approach, the study quantifies that the monetary benefits of reducing children’s indoor NO2 exposure while at school would range between £2.5 k per school if a child’s perspective based on child’s budget is adopted up to £60 k if a parent’s perspective is considered.

To ‘make public’ expresses a demand and an aspiration; materially – to protect and extend public housing provision at a time when austerity measures are dismantling it in ideal and form [Phillips and Erdemci, 2012]; procedurally – to make visible problematic processes of urban change that are increasingly hidden from public view under the pervasive metaphor of regeneration [Campkin, 2013]; and methodologically – to make public the act of research through long-term collaborations with residents and other practitioners, using archival research and socially-engaged performance practice that reveals spatial changes and their affects on social relations [Harvie, 2013]. The thesis draws on the idea of ‘multiple publics’ to re-conceptualise a constructive approach to public housing and to evaluate the ethic of ‘making public’ [Fraser, 1990]. It works between architecture and performance to forge new connections with the research of Forty, Rendell, Schneider and Roms, and choreograph relationships between buildings, texts and residents through critical acts of writing, dramaturgy and re-enactment. The practice is conducted through performative workshops that open a social, discursive and imaginative space for residents to re-enact the histories of each estate and build collective knowledge and experience. This collaborative work is shared with wider publics through a feature-length artist’s film, site-specific performance, and six-week exhibition, and is documented in the thesis as two acts, comprising scenes interspersed with reflective essays.

It seeks to identify the spatial conditions that, at multiple scales, mediate and support the operation of digital industries in inner-city locations. Drawing on ‘productionist’ approaches, which examine creative industries as an industry, work is conceptualized as six activities (producing, meeting, networking, learning, displaying, socializing) performed across four spatial settings: the extended workplace, workspaces, industry events, and the neighbourhood. This qualitative case study uses three data collection methods: semi-structured interviews with workers and industry actors, observations of selected settings, and secondary data. The area is an emergent cluster of digital firms known as ‘Silicon Roundabout’ and ‘Tech City’, providing a less explored but relevant case. The thesis’ contribution is threefold. First, it provides an empirical account of the spatiality of digital work in Shoreditch. This reveals a network of spaces used for work (base, ancillary, and events) suggesting a reconfiguration, and extension, of the ‘workplace’ in these industries. This spatial extension is limited and associated with spatial requirements of the tasks involved; the office still plays a central role in digital production. Second, the study identifies macro and micro spatial conditions that mediate and support these work patterns across the four spatial settings and advances the conceptualization of functional, social, and symbolic aspects of these relationships, expanding the understanding of why and how place matters in the digital economy. Third, the analysis reveals that ‘structured interaction’ and micro processes of spatial segregation and exclusion are critical to support a range of work and social practices in digital production. In contrast to influential accounts that associate creative cities with diversity and tolerance, at the scale of these spatial practices, processes of selection and quest for sameness underpin the operation of these industries within urban space(s).",, , ,[], ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available",['Islington'],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": [[-0.0875, 51.5257]]}, ""properties"": {}}"

The digitalisation and deregulation of the industry since the 1950s has been at the heart of this fear, giving rise to a situation whereby the more complex and rapid financial transactions become, the less visible and less easily regulated they are. Consequently the global economy is often perceived to be a black box within which immaterial capital-flows circulate, unencumbered by the inconveniences of geography or the built environment. Yet the reality of this system is far from friction free. The world of financial services is orchestrated around people and places, co-ordinated through infrastructure and architecture, and accommodated in offices and cities. While the financial transaction itself may be an immaterial act, it relies upon a set of specific material conditions to take place. This thesis is an exploration of those conditions. Through an analysis of the urban and architectural development of the City of London, London’s financial district, in the post-war period, the research considers the extent to which there is a relationship between the structure of the financial system and the structure of the environment in which it operates. This thesis is the first comprehensive material investigation of a financial centre to date. Furthermore, it is the first study that can claim to have looked at the recent architectural history of the City of London in any depth. Buttressed by two episodes of destructive violence – World War II and the IRA bombings of the early 90s – which would each herald a new urban paradigm, the research charts the gradual deregulation of the UK finance industry and its manifestation in the built form, socio-spatial arrangement, and cultural milieu of the financial centre. Structured in the shape of a conceptual cross-section, the thesis is organised into four chapters that move from the urban scale of the City, through its streets, across its facades and into the micro-geography of its interiors, in the form of trading floors, offices and furniture. The aim is not to provide a descriptive inventory of buildings and streets, but rather to connect each material layer to the wider economic and regulatory developments in the global economy, thereby creating a constant dialogue between financial place and financial space.",, , ,[], ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available",['City of London'],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": [[-0.078017, 51.511861]]}, ""properties"": {}}"

Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.","Transport for London

While studies investigating subjective orientations among travellers have proliferated, open questions remain including the role of recent technological advances, the expansion of alternative mobility services, locally specific mobility cultures and residential selection. This paper presents the methods, results and policy implications of a comparative study aiming to understand mobility attitudes and behaviours in the wider metropolitan regions of Berlin and London. We specifically considered information and communication technology (ICT), new types of mobility services such as car sharing, electric cars and residential preferences. In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture. We identify such interventions for each segment and region and conclude that comparative assessment of attitudinal, alongside geographical, characteristics of metropolitan travellers can provide better strategic input for realistic scenario-building and ex-ante assessment of sustainable transport policy.","1.

This research argues similarities within submarkets are not only captured by its building and location characteristics but also in how each dwelling is inter-connected within its local area and embedded to the rest of the system. This research conjectures that spatial network local-areas as defined by community detection methods can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets. In order to test this conjecture, the hedonic approach will be used as an empirical strategy on the case study of London. The study found spatial network local areas correspond with planned known local area boundaries and that greater house price similarity is found within spatial network local-areas than between. The study also found that spatial network local area as defined by community detection technique can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets to explain house price. The contribution of this research is it represents a proof of concept in the use of community detection techniques in the definition of spatial housing submarket. Importantly it illustrates the significance in how spatial configuration influences housing market not just in terms of accessibility (Law et al. 2013) but also in terms of housing submarket.

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is such a concept. The objective of the FS-MaaS project is to propose the design of a MaaS concept for London, the MaaS-London, and examine its feasibility. To work towards the concept of MaaS-London, first, the supply and the demand sides of the London transport market are analysed. There are a variety of mobility services supplied in London such as car clubs (car sharing), ride sharing, bike sharing, public transport, rail and taxi which altogether make London an ideal ground to exploit MaaS-London. The MaaS-London is an integrated platform that includes registration and package selection, intermodal journey planning, booking, smart ticketing and payment functions so that the entire chain of transport can be managed in this centralised platform. The most outstanding feature of MaaS-London is the provision of mobility packages, which consist of tailored bundles of mobility services customised to individual needs. The feasibility study indicates that the introduction of MaaS-London will benefit both the supply and the demand side. Transport operators will benefit by creating a larger market via the integrated platform. Travellers will also welcome the concept due to travel expense and time reduction, and better service experience. MaaS-London is a feasible product that can well serve London transport market and contribute to London’s 2020 vision.",, , ,[], ,,,,,,,Technology and Computation ,,,,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

Laura Vaughan",,,Bartlett School of Architecture,"London and Manhattan constitute unique urban configurations which have claimed and conquered the metropolitan vision. This paper travels back in time to look for the foundations of these cities’ architectural and urban morphology. The study is focused on the architecture of the everyday, the vernacular buildings which collectively form the character of a city’s historical built environment. It discusses how both preconceived frameworks and emergent architectural decisions and societal rules have shaped the two cities throughout their spatial histories. Drawing evidence from historical and empirical data the analysis presented in this paper builds on space syntax research which investigates morphological processes in urban configurations. The paper looks at two contrasting cases of urban grids to contribute to the understanding of the way different spatial arrangements influence city form. The urban past of London and Manhattan is considered in terms of planning intentions, architecture, urban form and the embodied socio-cultural models and ideals. The approach emphasises the way architectural and urban scales were configured together to produce each city’s historical morphological identity and spatial culture. This stems from an effort to form a parallel understanding of both the building unit and the urban realm where this is situated. In this perspective, the discussion provides an overview on the one hand, of the building aggregation rules of the London terraced house and the Manhattan row house schemes; and on the other hand, the structure of the urban grid in each case. The aim is to shed light on the interplay of these two elements, underlining the challenge for any urban design approach: to tackle both buildings and streets along the lines of a unifying and diachronic spatial logic. The study considers the syntactical and morphological properties of urban space, looking at the building, the block and the city scales.

Supervised and operated via its members, the components of each institution were tied together through a mode of exchange that prized face-to-face contact, reputation and trust, epitomised by the Stock Exchange motto Dictum Meum Pactum (‘My word is my bond’). The latter was made concrete via messenger-operated payment and clearing systems, organised around the hours of trade, provoking the need for proximity between institutions and specific architectural arrangements and resulting in an urban agglomeration of banks and other institutions in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England. The advent of digital technology entailed a decline in the economic significance of pedestrian activity in the City. The shift from manual, paper operations to onscreen transactions made redundant the kinetic network of brokers and messengers that once formed the circulatory system for banking and finance. This paper considers the way in which such shifts ultimately reconfigured the nature of the street as public space and argues that, as fundamental parts of the financial transaction were removed from the City’s thoroughfares, the street would no longer be an extension of the workplace, but a space of leisure. Exploring concepts such as ‘transaction’, ‘regulation’ and ‘exchange’ as social processes with material consequences, this paper attempts to chart the historical link between the street and economic activity, through analysis of the City’s myriad pedestrian ways and changing attitudes to planning public space in the fifty years following the Second World War.",, , ,[], ,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,,['City of London'],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": [[-0.078017, 51.511861]]}, ""properties"": {}}"

In recent years, the focus of economic development initiatives has shifted away from supply side initiatives, such as fiscal incentives and the direct provision of premises, towards a consideration of the collective provision of infrastructure and services, in order to meet demands of businesses and workers in cities where there is already strong demand and growth. As well as this shift from supply- to demand-side initiatives, there has been a change in the political ideological approach to land and property development, away from public sector direct provision and funding, to place greater onus on the private sector to deliver development, infrastructure and services. The introduction of ‘affordable workspace’ planning policies by local authorities in London from the early 2000s is part of this shift – building on more established key worker and affordable housing policies. This paper evaluates the success of affordable workspace planning policies in thirteen mixed use schemes in London, from the perspectives of developers and workspace providers, who are responsible for delivering and managing the affordable workspace. First, it finds that the perspective of the developer, in particular whether it sees affordable workspace policy as (a) an opportunity, (b) a ‘tool’ to secure planning permission or (c) a burden, is mostly influenced by the way in which the affordable workspace emerged within the proposal. Developers’ perspectives and the success of their partnerships with workspace providers are critical to the successful delivery of affordable workspace within the scheme. Second, the findings show that ‘affordable workspace’ is difficult to define and deliver, with different interpretations used by delivery partners and the ability of workspace providers to deliver affordability depends critically on their organisational model. Finally, the research shows that although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, it is not benefiting low-value manufacturers or small family-run retail and service businesses, nor is it generally benefiting start-ups. The implications of policy outcomes for economic development are considered; overall the beneficial impacts are limited. The research concludes that the predominant model of affordable workspace policy being promoted in London will fail to meet the aspirations of policy makers, with the limited success of policy further compounded by the global recession of the late-2000s.

Organizations cope with complexity by decomposing a project into different levels of systems integration with clearly-defined interfaces and buffers between levels and individual component subsystems. At the “meta systems integration” level, an organization has to be established with the capabilities to understand the total system of systems, manage external interfaces with the multiple stakeholder sand coordinate the integration of its component parts. At the “system integration” level, efforts are made to manage each individual system as a loosely-coupled, relatively self-contained subsystem with defined interfaces to coordinate interdependencies with other parts of overall array.

Although external factors, such as urban morphology and greening, may influence the spatio-temporal variation of overheating risk, the individual building characteristics are also likely to be important. This paper presents the results of EnergyPlus dynamic thermal simulations of 3456 combinations of dwelling types and characteristics selected to represent the London domestic stock. Two Design Summer Year weather files were used to represent the current and future climate: the CIBSE 1984–2004 and a UKCP09 future weather file (50th percentile of external temperature, 2050s, medium emissions scenario). Appreciable variation between dwelling types but generally greater variation within dwelling type was found depending on such factors as orientation, surrounding buildings and insulation levels. Under the current climate, the insulation levels had considerable impact on indoor temperatures, with combined retrofitting of roof insulation and window upgrades reducing daytime living room temperatures during the warmest continuous 5-day period of modelling by, on average, 0.76 °C (%95C.I. 0.63, 0.89 °C) for mean temperature and 1.30 °C (%95C.I. 1.05, 1.54 °C) for maximum temperature. On the other hand, internally retrofitted walls and floors tended to increase daytime living room temperatures, with a combined effect of 0.46 °C (%95C.I. 0.33, 0.60 °C) increase in mean temperature and 0.71 °C (%95C.I. 0.47, 0.96) increase in maximum temperature.

Improvements are made on existing empirical measures by providing comprehensive intra-metropolitan analysis; increasing network routing accuracy with UK public transport timetable and GPS-based average road speed data; allowing multimodal travel; and developing metrics suitable for travel sustainability analysis. The output unit of CO2 emissions has been selected to enable the integration of mode-choice and travel distance data, and to aid compatibility with integrated assessment applications. The methodology is applied to the case study of the London Region for the year 2001. A very high degree of intra-metropolitan variation is identified in the results. Employment sub-centres diverge in their per-capita CO2 emissions by up to 300%, with specific problems of carbon intensive commuting to major airports and the specialised employment region of the Western Sector. These findings indicate that subcentre travel variation may be intrinsic to polycentric urban structures. The paper discusses means to improve the methodology, in relation to issues of coefficient disaggregation and modelling more complicated multi-modal trips.","Transport for London

Contemporary world cities are characterised by high levels of economic specialisation between intra-urban centres, an expanding regional scope, and market-led processes of development. These issues have been given relatively little attention in sustainable travel research, yet are increasingly defining urban structures, and need to be much better understood if improvements to urban transport sustainability are to be achieved. London has been argued to be the core of a polycentric urban region, and currently there is mixed evidence on the various sustainability and efficiency merits of more decentralised urban forms. The focus of this research is to develop analytical tools to investigate the links between urban economic geography and transportation sustainability; and apply these tools to the case study of the London region. An innovative methodology for the detailed spatial analysis of urban form, employment geography and transport sustainability is developed for this research, with a series of new application of GIS and spatial data to urban studies. Firstly an intra-metropolitan scale of spatial analysis is pursued, allowing both an extensive regional scope and a sufficiently intensive local level of detail to analyse the decentralisation processes described above. Secondly a series of detailed spatial datasets are introduced to analyse employment geography and dynamics, including business survey data and fine-scale real-estate data. For the measurement of accessibility, detailed network analysis and congestion data is used. Finally for the assessment of transportation sustainability, an indicator of CO2 emissions at intra-urban scales is developed, and is calculated for the 6.5 million journey-to-work trips in the study region. The results highlight extreme intra-urban variation in accessibility, employment geography and travel carbon emissions with clear relevance to urban form and sustainable travel debates in the London region.","1.

The hedonic pricing method is based on the theory that the value of a good is based on the combination of the many attributes the good possesses. In the case of housing this includes domestic facilities, access to services and so on. The value of individual attributes can be inferred from the hedonic model, and thus it is a useful method for estimating the value of attributes that influence house prices, particularly where markets do not exist such as for green spaces. This research builds on the original study with better green space data and a wider range of built environment and locational factors analysed at a more detailed spatial scale.",GLA Economics,"London SE1 2AA, (51.5048513, -0.0786925)",Greater London Authority,"[(51.5048513, -0.0786925)]",Collaborator(s),,,Collaborators,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

However, the smallest scale of mixed use, the building, still suffers from a mistrust of the property market: the lack of experience, the tenure structures, the technical difficulties are all issues that lead developers to favour single use buildings. However, in increasing number of mixed use buildings shows that the tendency is changing. Among other developments, Oxo Tower and Kings Place in London and the Macdonald warehouse and Claude Bernard in Paris are examples of vertical mixed use implemented despite the issues mentioned above. Based on these examples and on more theoretical literature, the dissertation defines and analyses the obstacles to mixed use buildings and compares the French and the English contexts. Lessons can be learnt from these developments and from the differences between the two countries in order to build a mixed use buildings knowledge and foster the development of this niche market.","lain Tuckett, Alison Pinner, Christine Czechowski

The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure.Methods: Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with high or very high exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure.Results: Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a high or very high risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between high or very high exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to no exposure likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for number of residents and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern.Conclusion: This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit. As health status was self-reported, this association requires further investigation.",,"

Drawing on a survey of and interviews with planners in London, it discusses the construction of knowledge within the dynamics of planning organisations and the potential for learning to promote a more sustainable built environment. Wenger's concept of communities of practice frames the analysis, alongside consideration of the translation of knowledge into bureaucratic and usable forms and the role of knowledge brokers in this process.","1.

While it is now widely speculated that this is causing gentrification and displacement, the extent to which it has forced low-income households to move away from their local community remains to a large degree conjectural and specific to those estates that have undergone special scrutiny. Given the lack of spatially disaggregated migration data that allows us to study patterns of dispersal from individual estates, in this article, we report on an attempt to use consumer-derived data (LCRs) to infer relocations at a high spatial resolution. The evidence presented suggests that around 85% of those displaced remain in London, with most remaining in borough, albeit there is evidence of an increasing number of moves out of London to the South-East and East of England.","1.

This collaborative public history project 'City of Women London' aimed to redraw and reimagine the classic London Underground map to produce an alternative map, replacing existing station names with the names of remarkable female or non-binary Londoners who have had an impact on the city’s history. 

Led by writer Reni Eddo-Lodge and actor Emma Watson, who worked with writer and activist Rebecca Solnit and partnered with Transport for London (TfL), the project – called City of Women – draws from figures in arts, sports, activism, science, media, law, medicine and beyond. The digital version, led by Dr Leah Lovett (UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis), allows people to learn more about each person and their lives. The online map launches with featured biographies and interviews from contemporary women and non-binary people.

The project aims to identify remarkable female or non-binary Londoners who have had an impact on the city’s history in some way. It allocates them to each of the stations depicted on the London Tube map according to their connections to a local area. Some of these people might be household names, others unsung heroes or figures from London’s hidden histories. The names are drawn from arts, civil society, business, politics, sport, with suggestions gathered by consulting with historians, writers, curators, community organisers, women’s rights organisations, museums, and librarians and through an open call to the public to submit ideas. 

The interactive City of Women London map has been developed by Dr Leah Lovett, Dr Duncan Hay, and Montaz Marche from the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) using Memory Mapper, an open source toolkit for mapping stories of place developed at CASA.","Reni Eddo-Lodge (writer)

Tanhua Jin ",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"The concept of the 15-minute city was developed for inner city districts in major metropolitan centres, but it is also highly relevant to outer metropolitan areas and smaller towns and cities to foster more sustainable travel behaviour. Yet, the latter areas often have additional sustainability challenges including greater car dependence, struggling local retail centres, disintegrated housing developments and weaker active travel infrastructure. The ENHANCE project is designed to understand the barriers for the application of 15mC principles in outer metropolitan areas and small cities and provide evidence to improve local planning decision-making. This will be achieved through three main tasks:

1. Creating multi-modal composite accessibility indicators that capture progress towards 15-minute city goals and that highlight the degree to which daily travel needs can potentially be fulfilled within local trips.

2. Analysing actual travel behaviour in relation to the 15-minute city objectives to describe the degree to which different societal groups fulfil their daily travel needs by local trips in practice and to understand current barriers to meeting sustainable travel objectives.

3. Develop a modelling environment that allows the development of future scenarios that enhance accessibility by the provision of transport infrastructure, adapting travel behaviour or (re)developing the city.","Prospective Labs

The growth of these mega-city regions is heavily influenced by the fusion of existing cities as well as by rapid continental scale migration. This growth is generating severe problems of social segregation, connectivity, mobility, and income inequalities that require new and powerful methods of analytical understanding such as those being developed using real-time ‘big’ data sources and new information technologies. We propose to develop a platform for prediction and urban governance using the Pearl River Delta ‘Greater Bay Area’ mega-city region as a demonstrator, bringing sustainability indicators and simulation models from the Greater London and urban Holland (the Randstad) regions to inform the development of an urban data and simulation platform relevant to designing and testing scenarios for new modes of transport and the alleviation of socio-economic inequalities in the Bay Area.

Adam Dennett",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"""VU.CITY has created the largest, most accurate and truly interactive digital city model, which provides a revolutionary tool for architects, developers, advisors and the public sector.

VU.CITY saves time and money for anyone involved in planning or development and is directly leading to better decision making, with 18 of 33 London councils already using it. Using game engine technology, users can import their own 3D model into VU.CITY to immediately place their proposals in context and test their visual impact. VU.CITY is fast becoming the industry standard method of considering development plans. The presentation of proposals through VU.CITY will speed up and increase engagement in mandatory public consultations and is already helping councillors make better, more informed decisions in planning committee meetings.

Colouring London (CL) is a web based Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiative, designed by the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), UCL, and created in collaboration with Historic England. Approximately 12 categories of data are being crowdsourced including building age, use, type size, designation status and rebuild history. CL is providing the first ever public resource, and first port of call, for data on the characteristics of London's building stock.

CL is currently limited to 2D maps. The proposed project will develop an API to feed CL data directly into VU.CITY to be visualised in 3D. The project also aims to create an app based version of VU.CITY to work on mobile phones (YOUR.VU.CITY). This will enable members of the public to view proposed developments from their current geographical location. The user will simply point their smart phone in the direction of the proposed development site and it will appear within the screen view. Users will be able to provide feedback on the proposed development through the app. Based on the feedback, developers will be able to revise their proposalst. Similarly, developers will be able to receive suggestions and feedback on mixed-use community development sites from potential end users.","VUCITY LIMITED

These include procedures like the standard eye test and photographs taken of the eye to less heard of procedures like the Humphrey Field Analyser and the ORA. What is fundamental about these outpatient clinics is that each patient runs through the same procedures every visit. This means that the patients and the technician running the procedures go through very similar flows and patterns that can be optimised given the right technology and opportunities.  
This is precisely the problem that Project Hercules is attempting to solve. Using the pop-up clinic located at Brent Cross, which is easily reconfigurable and allows multiple different floor plans to be tested, the Project Hercules team aims to build a safer and more efficient clinic. Consenting patient and technician movements will be tracked using highly specialised Ubisense Ultra-Wideband sensors. Monitoring and recording people within a metre, these sensors will provide granular location data, which can be analysed on its own, aggregated to understand problematic areas or to potentially uncover what makes one layout much more efficient than another. In combination with in-person ethnographic observations and measurements of environmental conditions such as CO2 levels, these analyses will be a fundamental part of how future Moorfields Eye Hospital clinics will be designed in the future."," Hari Jayaram (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust )

Research has also shown the capacity of residents to self-organise, contest top-down schemes, and propose community-led alternative approaches (Sendra & Fitzpatrick, 2020). The aim of this research project is to co-produce with residents and communities a brief for the regeneration of the Trellick Tower and Cheltenham Estate, which includes how the process should be, how communities should participate in decision-making, how the process should reach the diversity of communities in the area, which are the spaces that people value, what needs to improve, and what kind of development they would want. For achieving these objectives, the project will use a Participatory Action Research approach, where the research outputs are co-produced with the communities affected. Research methods and activities will include co-design workshops, semi-structured interviews, following the progress of the project by a community steering committee, and a public seminar/conference.",Trellick Tower Residents’ Association,"(51.5223412, -0.2074646)",Trellick Tower Resident's Association,"[(51.5223412, -0.2074646)]",,,,Collaborators,,,,Planning and Policy,Museum of London,,,Worktribe ,,['Kensington and Chelsea'],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": [[-0.207465, 51.522341]]}, ""properties"": {}}"

Tatiana Moreira de Souza",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"The short-term renting of a property to visitors is not new. However, the rise of internet-based platforms — digital marketplaces that match supply and demand — has fuelled the diversification and expansion of this practice in an unprecedented way. The market leader in the short-term accommodation sector is Airbnb, created in 2008 to allow landlords and tenants to advertise their homes for short-term rental. There now exists a variety of short-term rental platforms that differ in terms of their business models (peer-to-peer, business-to-consumer or both), their links with giants of the online travel industry, their geographical coverage and the types of accommodation they offer. Their offer has grown rapidly over the past decade, although interrupted in 2020 by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The likelihood is that as recovery from the pandemic comes about, the short-term rental market will rebound. This project analyses and compares how public actors in large European cities have attempted to regulate platform-mediated short-term rentals, and outlines which implementation and enforcement challenges they have faced in doing so. The objectives of the research were to:
Identify the different types, and arguments, of interest groups and stakeholders who have been advocating or opposing the regulation of platform-mediated short-term rentals;
Identify the regulations put in place in large European cities to manage or control the phenomenon, and compare their instruments, modalities and degrees of stringency;
Assess how public authorities perceive the effectiveness of the regulations to date and identify the challenges they face in terms of implementation and enforcement.","HospitalityUK

The research involves co-creating a web-based and end-user led prototype called a virtual decision room (VDR) to help movements towards a sustainable digital society. The VDR will be co-created with local government, the local community, regulators and water utility companies ('end-users') to collaboratively plan and evaluate the environmental sustainability of urban growth planning scenarios using co-designed water neutrality indicators during the project. The VDR will use a whole-water system Digital Twin (FuturaWat) that supports evidence-led water neutral planning for place making. This will be achieved by integrating two state-of-art digital tools: GIS-based ground risk calculator (GRISC) and whole-water system model (CityWat) with a participatory process to facilitate end-user discussion and decision-making on housing and water system planning scenarios. The key novelty of the proposed research is in applying systems approaches to infrastructure planning, collaborative working and sustainability evaluation.

The VDR will be tested by applying it to Greater Manchester and London Borough of Enfield case study examples to enable end-users to align their strategic planning and water management priorities. The VENTURA concept was co-developed with our project partners, who have helped us formulate Greater Manchester (GM) and London Borough of Enfield (LBE) case examples. In GM the work will directly support the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) 'levelling up' strategies and help them to holistically address 'challenges to delivery when considering wider issues such as flood risk, brownfield land remediation, environmental degradation and wider resilience to climate change'. The LBE case example will support Enfield Council in their transition to a digital platform that will enable correlation of infrastructure needs with investment opportunities and help them to more effectively engage with local communities and discuss local plans, which currently do not include water demand and water quality evaluation because of lack of evidence. Both case examples will explicitly account for community perspectives through collaborations with partner local NGOs: Thames21 (LBE) and The Mersey Rivers Trust (GM).

VENTURA directly addresses the current UK Government's high-profile strategic initiatives including 'Planning for the future' White Paper and the National Digital Twin Programme. In particular, VENTURA provides a proof-of-concept for the White Paper's highly ambitious proposals that seek to reduce the duration of the planning cycle significantly, supporting net gains in the quality of the environment and front-loading public engagement in the planning system to the plan-making stage of place-making.

The research will adapt traditional working practices to help the work become more sustainable. This will be formalised through the development of a sustainability policy for the research and will include initiatives such as monitoring and managing environmental performance by embedding into project management, reporting progress and sharing good practice with other EPSRC projects.",Enfield Council,"(51.6549375, -0.0803125)",Enfield Council,"[(51.6549375, -0.0803125)]",,,,Collaborators,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,Planning and Policy,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Worktribe ,,[],"{""type"": ""Feature"", ""geometry"": {""type"": ""MultiPoint"", ""coordinates"": []}, ""properties"": {}}"

Understanding the factors that contribute to high indoor temperatures in care homes is crucial in developing strategies to avoid summertime overheating and the associated negative health impacts, which are expected to intensify as a result of climate change. The pilot project is undertaking preliminary work in five care settings in London to monitor the summertime conditions experienced by residents and staff, model future overheating risks and investigate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the risk of overheating. It will then bring together the learning from monitoring and modelling in expert workshops to explore the implications for guidelines and regulations, and the potential for scaling-up the project to a national scale. The work will be of interest to relevant stakeholders from the built environment, social care, public health and policy development.

As a result of global climate change, the UK is expected to experience hotter and drier summers and heatwaves are expected to occur with greater frequency, intensity and duration. According to recent climate change projections by the Met Office, increases in mean daily temperatures could be up to 5.4 deg. C during the summer months and 4.2 deg. C during winter by 2070 under a high emissions scenario. In 2003, 2,091 heat-related deaths were reported in the UK alone as a result of the European heatwave, meaning future temperature increases could lead to a parallel rise in heat-related mortality. The UK also currently has a rapidly growing number of old people, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035, compared with 8% in 2012. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The 2003 heatwave demonstrated that older people in care settings are at the highest risk of heat-related mortality. People aged over 65 years spend more than 80% of their time in residential environments or care settings, and people aged over 85 years more than 90%. Therefore, the indoor environment is a huge moderator of heat exposure in older populations: poor building design and the lack of effective heat management in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents. Care facilities function as both a home for residents and a workplace for staff, meaning that the people sharing those spaces can have diverging needs and preferences making overheating prevention measures difficult to enforce. Interactions between staff and residents play an important role in preventing overheating in care settings and it has previously been noted that staff are often made to prioritise warmth due to wide recognition of the detrimental effect cold weather can have on old-age health, leading to overheating risks being overlooked. Understanding factors that contribute to indoor summertime overheating in care homes is crucial in developing methods to prevent overheating and the subsequent negative health impacts.

Previous research by the applicants has indicated that care facilities are already overheating even under non-extreme summers, highlighting the need to develop timely prevention measures given the way temperatures are expected to rise in the UK over the next century. A key target for climate adaptation in care settings is to limit such risks by introducing passive cooling strategies via building design and occupant behaviour. Development of passive cooling strategies will reduce the likelihood of uptake of mechanical cooling, which would undermine government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the principal aim of the project is to undertake preliminary work to develop methods that will support a system of care provision in the UK that is adequately prepared for rising heat stress under climate change. The project will undertake pilot work in five care settings in the UK to monitor the thermal environment and conduct surveys with residents, frontline care staff and care home managers. Within these buildings, it will test novel approaches for understanding the comfort levels of the residents and relating this to the thermal environment. It will also test novel measurement techniques for assessing impact of heat on the health of the residents. Via detailed modelling work, it will then test methods to assess future overheating risks and to evaluate the effectiveness of overheating mitigation strategies. Throughout the project the work will bring together multidisciplinary research perspectives with those of care home practitioners and other stakeholders. Via these packages of work, plans for the large-scale project that is so urgently needed in this area will be developed.","Emer O'Connell (Public Health England)
