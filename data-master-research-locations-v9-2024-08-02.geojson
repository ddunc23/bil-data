This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60% reduction target in CO2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting policy packages that are in turn assembled into clusters of policy packages to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the policy packages are used to a \u2018high\u2019 level of application.

We begin by sketching how employment models based on input\u2013output and multiplier relationships are used to predict future employment aggregates by type and then we illustrate how these aggregates are distributed to small zones of an urban region in ways that make them consistent with the distribution of population and service employment allocated using spatial interaction-allocation models. In essence, the structure we are developing, which is part of an integrated assessment of resilience to extreme events, links input\u2013output analysis to the allocation of employment and population using traditional land use transportation interaction models. The framework then down scales these activities which are allocated to small zones to the physical level of the city using GIS-related models functioning at an even finer spatial scale. The crucial link in this chain is how we distribute detailed employment types generated from the input\u2013output model to small zones consistent with the way population and services are allocated using the LUTI model. To achieve this, we introduce an explicit employment forecasting model in which employment types are related to functions of floorspace that they use. These are estimated using linear regression analysis which enables future predictions of their location to be scaled in proportion to the totals generated from the input\u2013output framework. These future estimates of floorspace condition the supply side of the model, and combined with accessibility indicators, provide the heart of the employment location model.

Thrift, a proponent of non-representational theory conceptualises space as an emergent property of practice that occurs prior to conscious definitions. Hence, space is a site of open-ended possibilities, a non-discursive affordance to life in a given locale. Conversely, place is a more conscious and meaningful construction that people use to understand the space they live in. Although it is a complex construction in its own right, \u2018a constellation of processes rather than a thing\u2019 (Massey 2005, 141), place is distinguished by including social narratives and meanings. The concept of place, therefore, extends beyond non-reflexive practices and material flows, incorporating instead purposeful social action in the form of political activities, values, norms, memories, stories and histories. This interplay between spatial materialities, socialities and culture, which transforms a generic space into a culturally charged place, is conventionally known as place-making. Place-making activities occur when we make efforts to define, understand, experience, navigate, utilise, modify or regulate what is happening in and with space. Therefore, place-making activities bridge between space and place. They draw on the mundane practices that serve to extend or maintain local social networks through face-to-face interaction, in addition to more purposive efforts to build a sense of place and belonging. Place-making then, is about the production of locality:  the set of processes that communities used to build a sense of place out of space (Appadurai 1996; Feld and Baso 1996).

The project investigated five present-day temporary projects sited on vacant land in London. Conscious of the long history of creative temporary occupations, the project pushes against the ephemeral nature of interim projects of the past, strategically documenting the five case studies through interviews, film, site surveys and photographs.\nThe specific purpose of this paper is to contextualise this recent fieldwork against the wider historical background of the creative temporary uses of vacant urban space, therefore negotiating between definitions of \u2018vacant\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019. Vacant spaces have been historically associated with dereliction or abandonment, \u2018lost space\u2019 (Trancik 1986), \u2018urban voids\u2019 and \u2018cracks in the city\u2019 (Loukaitou-Sideris 1996). Against the perception of vacancy as waste and emptiness, a more positive reading has been promoted through the notion of the \u2018terrain vague\u2019 (de Sola-Morales 1995).\nAlthough the present-day case studies emerged out of a very particular political, economic and cultural context, that of the late-2000s recession, this is not the first time that temporary uses have emerged in the history of London. Some of the case studies of the research project are located on sites with legacies of use that stretch back far beyond the 20th century and such histories complicate our readings of these short-term projects. The paper is however primarily concerned with the post-war context of London, up to the present day. Using the case studies as a spur for reflection, it provides an overview of the key moments in the evolution of creative temporary projects developed in vacant spaces. The discussion\nalso highlights links between past and present projects. Setting out from the post-war reconstruction years, the paper explores the 1960s countercultural projects as well as the 1970s post-countercultural community garden movement and the urban ecology turn. It then considers the impact of an increasingly global environmental awareness in the 1980s, leading up to the 1990s regeneration boom. This broad survey is supported by specific historical examples of creative use - some of which have proved to be truly temporary whilst\nothers have managed to endure - explored through published material, interviews with initiators and archival photographic records.\nThrough this historical review the paper links London projects to wider movements worldwide, with particular references to US and Europe where a direct influence can be established. Key themes emerging that provide insights into practices and ideologies relating to \u2018emptiness\u2019 are discussed and their legacies for contemporary urban projects identified.

Much of the critical literature on neoliberal urban development and many of the policy frameworks that shape planning systems characterise the real estate and investment sectors in a relatively simplified way.

Such characterisations are becoming increasingly important as regulators in major cities such as London and Toronto are calling for the introduction of new policy technologies and techniques to try and exert greater territorial control over increasingly fluid investment flows, real estate actors and other institutions within cities.

In this chapter, I first interrogate these arguments, using qualitative evidence, before turning to the case study of a still-unfolding major infrastructure-led redevelopment, Crossrail, around Tottenham Court Road Station in central London, to highlight the more profound ways that LGBTQ+ venues are networked into processes of urbanization. In this case, in 2006, we see the first attempt by City Hall to name a threat to a venue specifically because of its negative impact on a protected minority, defined under the category of \u2018sexual orientation\u2019.

Smaller-scale venues in the vicinity, including those proactively inclusive of more marginalized LGBTQ+ people, were overlooked and closed. Often opportunistically located in precarious sites and buildings during temporary breaks in redevelopment cycles, LGBTQ+ venues of all models are vulnerable once those cycles accelerate. Under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, following a crisis of closures in 2015, and after a period of extensive activism to protect and reopen queer spaces, licensed LGBTQ+ venues have now been categorized as \u2018social and cultural infrastructure\u2019 in policy discussions.

Evidence from past heatwave periods indicates that London\u2019s Urban Heat Island effect contributes substantially to heat-related mortality rates. During a warm period in 2006, the proportion of heat deaths attributable to this effect was estimated to be 37.7% in outer London, 46.6% in inner London and 47.2% in central London, compared to a reference rural location. The relative effect of the heat island needs to be also examined in conjunction with the influence of individual building geometry, fabric and system characteristics. Epidemiological analyses of London mortality records have demonstrated that the spatial variation of heat-related mortality in London reflects background mortality rates related to population age. As such, higher levels of excess heat-related mortality occur in areas towards the outskirts of London with larger proportions of older residents. Housing features, however, cause a larger variation in temperature exposure and associated risks than the heat island intensity alone.

This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity.

However, such models have not taken into account the detailed hygric behaviour of the building stock under flooding and drying conditions which can vary significantly between property types, and can lead to prolonged damp and health problems. To address this problem, a building stock model of central London has been developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), with information on the age, structure, and height of each dwelling and assumptions about built form based on historical building standards and surveys. This paper describes a novel methodology for the development of a building stock model with the necessary information to carry out hygrothermal simulations of the penetration of water into the building envelopes of flooded homes and the subsequent drying under different environmental scenarios. It discusses how the risk of damp in flooded homes can be modelled using hygrothermal methods and supplemented with mould models.

We investigated the spatial variation in heat-related mortality risks across London due to population age, urban heat island (UHI) and building characteristics. Methods Dynamic building physics models were run for 126 different age and built form variants of buildings statistically representative of the London housing stock, outputting average maximum daily internal temperatures for a hot summer period in 2006. Internal and modelled UHI temperature estimates for the same period in London were mapped to individual dwellings in Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and deviations of building-specific indoor and outdoor temperatures from the London-average were calculated and summarised at ward level. Office of National Statistics age-specific absolute mortality data and the above-calculated UHI and indoor temperature anomalies were then used to estimate spatial variation in mortality according to an age-specific relative risk function for heat in London. Results There was appreciable variation in indoor temperatures under the modelled climate, with a mean maximum range of 2.5\u00b0C. Modelled results indicate that the largest mortality risks may lie in outer London, as the elderly population is larger there than in Central London. Top-floor flats in multiple occupancy buildings and bungalows were found to be the most at-risk dwelling types. Limitations in building stock information and occupancy scenario assumptions mean that some buildings may be worse than modelled. Conclusions These results indicate that UHI and indoor temperatures may cause an appreciable spatial variation in the risks from heat-related mortality, but that the driving factor remains population age.

It includes threedimensional information about buildings including their heights, volumes, wall areas, floor areas and the\n distribution of activities between different floors. These data are drawn from University College London Energy\n Institute\u2019s existing 3DStock model of London. Within the model information is attached on the ages of\n buildings, their materials of construction, and (in some cases) their servicing systems. Energy Performance\n Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) are also attached to premises and dwellings along\n with gas and electricity energy consumption.\n Buildings in London are responsible for over 65% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributed\n to the Greater London region in 2016. Reducing CO2 emissions that can be attributed to buildings is the key\n focus of this work in line with the GLA\u2019s ambition to dramatically reduce these overall CO2 emissions; aiming to\n make London a zero-carbon city by 2050.\n Improving the energy performance of existing buildings has to be a key strategy if the overall CO2\n emissions are to be reduced. Knowing the characteristics and current energy efficiency of the building stock is\n the first step towards reducing direct and indirect CO2 emissions from these buildings. Collecting the data is\n one challenge, but making sense of these huge quantities of data is a bigger challenge. Structuring the data can\n help here and so for this paper we present the evaluation of energy efficiency of buildings in London using\n urban density to aggregate the data. Energy efficiency is measured from both EPCs and energy consumption.\n Some of the existing measures that might influence current energy efficiency are then shown at different levels\n of urban density. Finally, in order to address the improvement of the energy efficiency we quantify the\n \u2018potential\u2019 improvements of these buildings (according to the EPC recommendations) and hence the suitability\n of different retrofit solutions, again aggregated by urban density. The results show that energy use intensity\n decreases as urban density increases; that urban density has some influence on existing efficiency measures\n and finally that most of the measures of retrofit potential change with increasing urban density.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Evans S, Godoy Shimizu D, Humphrey D, Steadman P, Ruyssevelt P, Liddiard R"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A typology of megaproject client models", "short_title": "A typology of megaproject client models", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Denicol J, Davies A"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London calling", "short_title": "World's top acousticians converge on capital for ICSV24", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Kang J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Assessing the Current and Future Risk of Overheating in London\u2019s Care Homes", "short_title": "The Current and Future Risk of Overheating in London\u2019s Care Homes", "subject_area": "", "department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "abstract": "The warming climate causes adverse effects on thermal\ncomfort and health, especially for vulnerable older\nadults.

Reducing energy demand by implementing rapid energy saving measures has been effective in mitigating many electricity shortages globally to date. This thesis investigates whether similar measures could be effective in the UK in the event of a natural gas shortage, using a case study of London\u2019s households. A mail survey was developed and sent to a sample of 1,600 households in London to investigate which energy saving actions respondents would implement in a gas shortage. The questionnaire suggested a hypothetical scenario, where the media and government asked households to save energy for one month and also included questions about the respondents, their households and their dwellings. The resulting energy savings were subsequently calculated for each household using \u2018MESAH\u2019, a computer model developed during this research. This model used energy saving estimates based on a review of literature about household activities that use energy. Using these assumptions, the savings achieved by the different households varied vastly, reaching an overall total of approximately 30% of normal gas and electricity use in January. This result was relatively stable during the winter season. It was however found to be very sensitive to assumptions taken about the energy savings, and whether the respondents implemented actions as stated in the survey. It also found that the different actions proposed had very disparate saving impacts. The savings calculated represent high estimates of energy saving potential, rather than predictions due to uncertainties and limitations in the research. The project identified rapid energy savings as an option for an emergency response, but stressed that this approach should only be taken in extreme situations", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Julien A, Croxford B, Barrett M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Residential Development and Sustainable Travel Patterns in the London Region 2011-22", "short_title": "The Widening Price Gap for Sustainable Housing", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "abstract": "London\u2019s sustainable planning aims are being affected by acute housing affordability challenges.

After accounting for geographical features, car ownership, population density, and spatial autocorrelation in spatial lag models, the disparities for ethnicity were found, as the mixed and other ethnic groups were more disadvantaged both in 2011 and 2021, while the Asian ethnic groups had a more advantaged position.

Simulations are performed with the urban surfaces represented and with the urban surfaces replaced with grass in order to calculate the urban increment on the local meteorology. The local urban effects were moderated to some extent by the passage of an onshore flow that propagated up the Thames estuary and across the city, cooling London slightly in the afternoon. Validations of screen-level temperature show encouraging agreement to within 1\u20132 K, when the urban increment is up to 5 K. The model results are then used to examine factors shaping the spatial and temporal structure of London's atmospheric boundary layer. The simulations reconcile the differences in the temporal evolution of the urban heat island (UHI) shown in various studies and demonstrate that the variation of UHI with time depends strongly on the urban fetch. The UHI at a location downwind of the city centre shows a decrease in UHI during the night, while the UHI at the city centre stays constant. Finally, the UHI at a location upwind of the city centre increases continuously. The magnitude of the UHI by the time of the evening transition increases with urban fetch. The urban increments are largest at night, when the boundary layer is shallow. The boundary layer experiences continued warming after sunset, as the heat from the urban fabric is released, and a weakly convective boundary layer develops across the city. The urban land-use fraction is the dominant control on the spatial structure in the sensible heat flux and the resulting urban increment, although even the weak advection present in this case study is sufficient to advect the peak temperature increments downwind of the most built-up areas.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "SI Bohnenstengel \nS Evans\nPA Clark \nSE Belcher"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Transport and climate change", "short_title": "Simulating the Options for Carbon Reduction in London", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Transport is a major user of carbon-based fuels, and it is increasingly being highlighted as the sector\nwhich contributes least to CO2 emission reduction targets.

By the seventeenth century, there were seven principal gates in the old wall: from east to west starting from the Tower, they were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate and Ludgate. On the bridge across the River Thames \u2013 the only point of entry to the City from the south \u2013 there were two more gates. The ditch, as John Stow recorded in his Survey of London (first published in 1598), was \u2018of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon\u2019. This treatment of the ditch points to how the urban fabric had long since pushed through the gates and beyond the old walls; this area \u2018without\u2019, but still under the City\u2019s jurisdiction, was known as the Liberties. In Hollar\u2019s map of London in the later seventeenth century (Fig. 1), the walls and gates are a clearly visible feature defining the core of the City, which none the less spreads beyond them, in particular to the west. The limits of the Liberties were marked on main roads by \u2018bars\u2019, usually consisting of posts and chains, as at Holborn (to the north) or Whitechapel (to the east). Temple Bar, however, situated on Fleet Street to the west of Ludgate, had been made a gateway by the mid-fourteenth century, a reflection of its importance as the main point of transition between the Cities of London and Westminster. As such Temple Bar was considered one of the City gates; it was the eighth gate in the engraved plate that accompanied John Strype\u2019s version of Stow\u2019s Survey, published in 1720.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Emily Mann"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012", "short_title": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "No abstract", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Mike Raco"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "The London Way", "short_title": "The Politics of London\u2019s Strategic Design", "subject_area": "", "department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "abstract": "Matthew Carmona tracks the vicissitudes of London\u2019s political engagement in urban design over the last decade.

In the UK, a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme was launched in 2010 and has been so successful in creating growth in the PV market that tariff digression has had to be accelerated. A loan scheme, the Green Deal, which provides up front capital for energy efficiency measures was launched in 2012.\n\nDespite the success of the FiT scheme, the penetration of PV in London has lagged behind other areas.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, 5.1% of spending on groceries in 2013 was transacted online, an increase from 3.8% in 2010. (The level was 1.1% in 2003.) Transport researchers face serious gaps in empirical data coverage of this phenomenon, however, because regional and national travel surveys typically collect limited information with which to establish how in-store and online shopping relate to one another. To address this issue, the authors employed a well-established data resource in a novel approach. The UK Living Costs and Food Survey is traditionally used to track aggregate household expenditure patterns and to monitor price inflation. This study drew on the unique nature of the survey's expenditure diary, in which respondents recorded each item that they purchased during a 2-week period; respondents also recorded whether each shopping occasion was in-store or online. Empirically, it was found that shopping basket characteristics (types of products being purchased) were significantly linked with channel choice (online versus in-store). Furthermore, with a twostage modeling approach, it was found that sociodemographic factors appeared to relate in different ways to adoption of online shopping in general and to the choice of online versus in-store for individual shopping occasions.

In 2018, British newspaper The Times published an expos\u00e9 of the international non-governmental organisation (INGO) Oxfam GB and its handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct of its staff in Haiti and the Philippines (known colloquially as the \u201cOxfam-Haiti scandal\u201d). An investigation into Oxfam GB by the Charity Commission, a government body that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales, found that the organisation\u2019s safeguarding strategy, approach and resourcing were significant areas of weakness that meant \u201cthe charity exposed itself to undue risk, amounting to mismanagement in the administration of the charity\u201d.Footnote 1 The lever of exposure to risks \u2013 including the risk of causing harm to others alongside reputational risks \u2013 led to major sector-wide investment and the growth of teams of safeguarding professionals that introduced new or shored up existing policies, practices, lines of reporting and accountability and engendered behavioural change. By 2022, the international development and charity sector has become well versed and proactive in its management and mitigation of risks within the organisation and those caused by the organisation. These are risks that can be known, boxed into processes attentive to them and contained so that organisations may continue their substantive work. This framework and approach to understanding and managing risk as an operational exercise seems profoundly unsuited to the next great challenge facing the international development and charity sector and the development sector more widely \u2013 a challenge that aims to undo its rules and institutions and disrupt its very paradigm of knowing.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Patel K"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Investigating the Implications of the London Heathrow Airport Expansion for the Landside Freight Industry", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Lee R, Shammut M, Allen J, Gao X, Yang T, Cao M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Changes in life expectancy and house prices in London from 2002 to 2019", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Bennett JE, Rashid T, Zolfaghari A, Doyle Y, Suel E, Pearson-Stuttard J, Davies B, Fecht D, Muller ES, Nathvani RS, Sportiche N, Daby HI, Johnson E, Li G, Flaxman S, Toledano MB, Asaria M, Ezzati M"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "An open-source automatic survey of green roofs in London using segmentation of aerial imagery", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Simpson CH, Brousse O, Mohajeri N, Davies M, Heaviside C"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A Community-based Whole Life Carbon Assessment", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Nava S, Chalabi Z, Bell S, Burman E"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Analysis of inequalities in personal exposure to PM2.5", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Ferguson L, Taylor J, Symonds P, Davies M, Dimitroulopoulou S"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Shrinking homes?

In Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, safety is one of the foundational needs of well-being. The built environment should be safe to use at all times of the day and for all groups of people. After dark, the appearance of the outdoor environment changes dramatically, and this could impact the opportunities for crime. This study investigated the impact of daylight on the rates of different types of crime by comparing the crime rates during selected periods of daylight and darkness. The study used records of crime data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By studying crimes in the week on either side of the twice-yearly clock change, it is possible to compare periods that are dark in one week and light in the other at the same clock time. Where the time at which the crime took place was known, and using the GPS coordinates of the specific crime, the solar altitude was calculated and used to determine if it was light or dark at the time of the crime. A similar calculation was used to see if the crime would have been in the dark or light in the week on the other side of the clock change. The headline result is that there was 4.8% (OR 1.07) more crime in the dark periods than the light ones. However, this increase was not uniform across all crime types, and there were some further complications in some results due to potential changes in the behavior of some victims after dark. For the crimes of theft from a person and robbery of personal property, there was a significant increase during the dark period. The availability of light had an impact on the rate of certain crimes. Whilst this does not provide any information about the impact of street lighting on crime, it does provide some idea of by how much crime could be reduced if better lighting was provided.",

technology use in neighbourhood life tend to foreground either media or space and treat the other as a backdrop. As a result, there is much research on the way neighbourhoods become the content of media and how media could be instrumentalised to improve local communities, but there is a lack of synthesis of media and built environment research allowing a nuanced understanding of the role of communication technology in neighbourhood life. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a richer set of interlinked concepts and methods than that which is currently available to describe urban communications. Existing theoretical frameworks are expanded upon through critical development of a number of approaches to \u2018placing\u2019 the main hyperlocal news blog for one neighbourhood: mapping the locations it discusses; analysing the geographical and network characteristics of its social media network; and the development of grounded theory about the use of media in the neighbourhood through qualitative interviews.\nThe main arguments hold that even at the hyperlocal scale, theories of the national public sphere can help understand the way that imaginaries of place are formed through media; that a focus on subjective imaginaries and non-instrumental storytelling enables a better description of hyperlocal media use than on its instrumental value; and that neighbourhoods should be described as communication ecologies formed of multi-modal actor-networks of people, places, and technologies, rather than as separate spatial and virtual realities. The findings are largely methodological, demonstrating the possibility of placing media by mapping the issues it frames; of illustrating links between spatial morphology and the distribution of issues and social media networks; of using qualitative data to spatialize theories of the formation of the public sphere; and a proposition for a new method for building a socio-technical interaction network demonstrating the structure of the hyperlocal communication ecology.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Bingham-Hall J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Sustainability as the success of a centre over time", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "29-31 August 2007\n\nAbstract\nThis paper argues that the concept of \u2018sustainability\u2019 is best approached in terms of the factors favourable to the persistence of socio-economic activity in a given centre over time. It suggests that the question of how some places are able to\u2018re-invent\u2019 themselves over successive historical periods lies at the heart of what sustainability actually means.\n\nThe absence of a strong definition of sustainability, often misinterpreted as an exclusively environmental term, has impeded proper understanding of the temporality it strongly implies. This is particularly true in the field of urban design where the relation of the built environment to socio-economic change is poorly theorised and rarely integrated into methodology.\n\nThis issue is addressed in this paper by drawing on preliminary research conducted by the EPRSC\u2019s Successful Suburban Town Centres project which runs for three years at UCL. A critical examination of the literature of sustainability and an evaluation of relevant time-series datasets provided the basis for an heuristic methodology able to distinguish a wide range of \u2018successful\u2019 suburban town centres. The methodology comprises a series of filters and sorting criteria employing socio-economic, geographical, historical and morphological data, backed up with fieldwork where necessary and integrated into a GIS.\n\nThe selection process produced a sample of suburban centres all of which may be considered to be \u2018successful\u2019 in the sense that they continue to function effectively despite histories of socio-economic change and physical transformation. The explanation for this appears to lie in their distinctive combinations of socio-economic diversity and morphological robustness. For this reason it is asserted that the long-term \u2018success\u2019 of these suburban centres should be considered as a prerequisite rather than an outcome of \u2018sustainability\u2019 which is too abstract a term to sufficiently articulate the particularities of place.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Griffiths S, Vaughan L, Haklay M, Sahbaz O"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Some Theoretical and Methodological Implications of Space Syntax Methodology for Historical GIS", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Griffiths S, Jones CE, Haklay M, Vaughan L"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "A morphological approach to the persistence of socio-economic activity in three suburbs of Greater London.", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "4 -

This research enhances standard walkability models with fieldwork that actively engages with the community to understand the factors that shape everyday mobility and walking behaviours. Amongst several factors, public transport accessibility was added as a spatial variable that contributes to walkability, whilst walkable land uses were selected to be appropriate to the specific (UK) context.\n \nThe model also incorporates an advanced method to evaluate the spatial structure of the street network instead of the standard approach of measuring intersection density. Here, space syntax network analysis methods are used, that examine the spatial relationship across the street network at a range of scales by looking at the geometric relationships between spaces. This method more closely accounts for spatial cognition and human wayfinding principles in the way that it uses the actual pedestrian routes taken through the urban environment as the basis for the evaluation of the street network. This method of assessing street network properties holds the potential for improving both walkability studies, and associated health research. It also aims to increase the awareness of the planning profession of the importance of the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the built environment in shaping walking behaviours, and enabling populations to live healthier lives through higher levels of active transport and physical activity.", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Dhanani AN, Vaughan L, Boniface S, Anciaes P, Scholes S, Mindell J"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Tall building management in London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Short MJ"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Community severance from major roads", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Mindell JS, Jones P, Haklay M, Scholes S, Groce N, Vaughan L"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "At home with LGBTQ Londoners", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Subverting domesticity", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Architectural history meets queer theory", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Carnell BS"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "London as art industry cluster", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Son JW"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Restoring street connectivity across the Great West Road in Hounslow, London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "", "primary_partnership_type": "", "data_source": "RPS", "authors": "Anciaes P"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"name": "", "full_title": "Determinants of Satisfaction, Loyalty and Landlord Advocacy amongst Private Rented Sector Tenants at East Village, London", "short_title": "", "subject_area": "", "department": "", "abstract": "Over the past five years, the private rented sector has become a significant asset class for institutional investors in the UK. One of the main determinants of returns from residential investment property is the income obtained from tenants\u2019 rent. Income return is affected by several factors, including residents\u2019 satisfaction and their loyalty (in renewing their lease). The ease with which a landlord can let vacant property also depends upon their reputation, the desirability of the neighbourhood, the rental terms and the properties themselves.\nThis paper analyses almost 5000 interviews with PRS tenants in the UK, conducted over a four-year period, to investigate determinants of resident satisfaction, loyalty (lease renewal) and willingness to recommend their landlord. Statistical analysis is performed using respondents\u2019 ratings of satisfaction with many aspects of their occupancy as explanatory variables. Comparisons are made between interviewees who renew their lease and those who do not renew.  \nThe research finds that \u201cease of doing business\u201d with their landlord is a strong predictor of residents\u2019 satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Other key indicators for lease renewal include relationship management, rent collection and value for money. Tenants\u2019 willingness to recommend their landlord depends mainly on their relationship with their landlord, how the landlord compares with tenants\u2019 previous landlords, and the property management service they receive.\nThis research should help to improve the landlord \u2013 tenant relationship in the Private Rented Sector", "partners": "", "primary_funder": "",
