It is plausible that these trends are contributing to regional accessibility inequalities, though quantitative research testing this link is limited. This paper examines differences in employment accessibility between Standard Occupational Classification groups in the London Metropolitan Region for 2011 for car, transit, bus only and walking modes. Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006–2016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits. Lower income groups are exposed to rent increases, though this is offset by social housing, which remains the most prevalent tenure in Inner London for low income classes.","1. Joana Barros

The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010–2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.","J.

Set up in 2006 by Mayor Ken Livingstone and his Architectural Advisor, Richard Rogers, the brief for the team was ‘to think about London, what made London unique and how it could be made better’. Sitting within London government but outside its formal statutory responsibilities, it was given freedom to question and challenge. The team had no power or money, but it did have the licence to operate without the usual constraints of government. With introductions from Ken Livingstone and Richard Rogers, Design for London covers the tumultuous and heady period of the first decade of this century when London was a test bed for new ideas. It outlines how key projects such as the London Olympics, public space programmes, high street regeneration and greening programmes were managed, critically examines the lessons that might be learnt in strategic urban design and considers how a design agenda for London could be developed in the future.
By providing an engaging account of the strategic approaches and work of Design for London, and documenting the particular methodology and approach to urban theory it developed, Design for London will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students of planning, urban design and architecture, and to current practitioners from the public, private and community sectors who are struggling to achieve regeneration through poorly understood ‘placemaking’ concepts.",,,,,,Co-authorship with industry partner(s),,,,Design,,,,REF 2021,

Built in the 1950s to supply landmark social housing project Churchill Gardens, the district heating system sent heat from nearby Battersea power station into the radiators of the housing estate. The network is a rare example in the United Kingdom, where, unlike other European states, district heating did not become widespread. Today the heating system supplies more than 3,000 homes in the London Borough of Westminster, having survived the closure of the power station and the privatization of the housing estate it supplies. Therefore, this article argues, the neighborhood can be understood as a heterotopia, a site of an alternative sociotechnical order. This concept is used to understand the layers of economic, political, and technological rationalities that have supported PDHU and to question how it has survived radical changes in housing and energy policy in the United Kingdom. This lens allows us to see the tension between the urban planning and engineering perspective, which celebrates this system as a future-oriented “experiment,” and the reality of managing and using the system on the estate. The article analyzes this technology-enabled standard of living as a social contract between state and citizen, suggesting this is a way to analyze contemporary questions of district energy.","1.

In the context of the global financial crisis, austerity and uneven growth, national, sub-national and local state actors are being compelled to adopt the increasingly speculative activities of urban entrepreneurialism to attract new capital, develop ‘innovative’ financial instruments and models, and establish new or reform existing institutional arrangements for urban infrastructure governance. Amidst concerns about the claimed ‘ungovernability’ of ‘global’ cities and city-regions, governing urban infrastructure funding and financing has become an acute issue. Infrastructure renewal and development are interpreted as integral to urban growth, especially to underpin the size and scale of large cities and their significant contributions within national economies. Yet, overcoming fragmented local jurisdictions to improve the governance and economic, social and environmental development of major metropolitan areas remains a challenge. The complex, and sometimes conflicting and contested inter-relationships at stake raise important questions about the role of the state in wrestling with entrepreneurial and managerialist governance imperatives. City and government actors are simultaneously engaging with financial actors, the financialisation of the built environment, the enduring and integral position of the state in infrastructure given its particular characteristics, the transformation of infrastructure from a public good into an asset class through the agency of private and state interests, and what relationships, if any, exist between ‘effective’ urban governance systems and improved economic performance.",,,,Think tank and IGO ,,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,,Planning and Policy,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,REF 2021,

The monitoring data indicated that London homes and, in particular, bedrooms are already at risk of overheating during hot spells under the current climate. Around 70% of respondents tended to open only one or no windows at night mainly due to security reasons.

They can be hypnotic to look at, but fractals are more than just pretty pictures. Their geometry can describe a plethora of structures, from the branching of blood vessels and brain cells to the shapes of rivers and coastlines. Roberto Murcio and collegues at University College London, UK, now demonstrate how London’s fractal network of streets has changed from being multifractal, scaling spatially according to multiple rules, to monofractal, with a single scaling rule.

The researchers analyzed nine digitized maps of London from 1786 to 2010 using a statistical approach that estimates the number of street intersections within the city. They found that from 1786 to 1920 the city was multifractal, that is, it had a heterogeneous distribution of street intersections with just as many areas having a lot as having only a few. After 1920, the network gradually lost its multifractality, and by 2010 it had become nearly monofractal with a homogeneous distribution dominated by regions with multiple intersections. The authors argue that the loss of multifractality was caused by the “green belt” of countryside around the city, which was introduced in the mid-1950s to contain urban sprawl.

The node-place-design model is an analytical approach, which investigates the interaction between land use, transportation and the walking friendliness around station areas. Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node- place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification- diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node-place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension – design – into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment. Overall, the paper provides a platform for further studies integrating strategic network and node-place-design attributes.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,REF 2021,

Citizen participation rates are usually low, implying that they may feel this way too. There are two good reasons for this feeling: On the one hand, public consultation often only occurs when it is a mandatory exercise required by government for development approval; on the other, when public consultation occurs it is after much time and effort has been invested by professionals to develop a scheme therefore change is made reluctantly or not at all. These factors create a reactionary and adversarial atmosphere during consultation. These structural limitations mean that there is no time to find alignment of interests between project developers and the public, or to develop trust and collaborations. This article explores how codesign games as a form of public participation can be done at an early stage of project development to contribute to finding alignment of interests and collaborations between project developers and different public interests. The empirical case study is focussed on the possibilities for the retrofit of sustainable sanitation systems in London. Three future sanitation systems were developed by 14 workshop participants. They demonstrate new alignments of interests, from methods of collection and treatment, to new economies of reuse and production. It also established reasons why the current water-based sanitation systems are obdurate, and the work involved in keeping the status quo.","Centre for Codesign Research, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts",https://adk.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/center-for-codesign-research,Co-Design,,,Co-Design,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,UCL Grand Challenges,,,REF 2021,

The empirical enquiry takes place in the context of the delivery of London Heathrow Terminal 2. Through an inductive theory building approach drawing upon semi-structured interviews with client-side project leadership, internal documents, publicly available data and ongoing engagement with the field, we identified three key capability-enabling mechanisms that help explain the genesis of project capabilities in inter-organisational settings: (1) reconfiguring project capabilities, (2) adapting project capabilities and (3) maintaining project capabilities. We discuss and expand these findings by engaging with theoretical ideas from project studies, and mainstream strategy, organisation, and management research to induce a dynamic model that can be helpful to guide future research, policy and management practices relating to the client side management of project capabilities.","Phil Wilbraham

The paper argues instead for a more recursive focus on the ways in which decisions taken in ‘source’ and ‘host’ locations need to be understood as part of a mutually-constitutive system of governance. Using the example of Chinese residential investment into London, it argues that investment trends, processes and outcomes reflect a recursive combination of regulatory and political changes in both the city and within China, with the latter becoming increasingly influential.

This process of financialisation, it is claimed, is driven by the needs of developers and investors, who are focused on maximising returns and limiting their social and economic liabilities. Planning agencies and traditional territory-based arrangements are viewed with increasing suspicion, as standing in the way of investment and acting as a brake on much needed house-building and regeneration. However, in this paper, drawing on detailed research with investors and developers in London, we argue that there needs to be a stronger focus in academic and policy writing on the multiple, variegated, and diverse calculations and framings that private sector actors take when making investment decisions. Too often their perspectives are caricatured and/or over-simplified. We show that perspectives and imaginations of planning and regulation are more complex and that many firms have realised that market success results from becoming more deeply embedded in the local political, social, and regulatory environments in which they are investing. A greater understanding of these multiple forms of calculation, in turn, opens up opportunities for the maintenance and/or implementation of more effective forms of territorially-based soft and hard regulation.

Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nat- ure of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demon- strate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning – being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research.","Addison Lee Limited

Closer investigation of the Bermondsey cluster highlights the importance of a number of interacting physical, social and economic factors in helping foster this growth.

The analysis draws on Latour’s writings on modes of politicisation to examine the processes and practices that shape contemporary urban governance. It uses the example of diversity planning to examine the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of urban politics. It shows that on the one hand diversity is represented in pragmatic, consensual, and celebratory terms. Under prevailing conditions of contemporary global capitalism, the ‘what’ of diversity has been politicised into an agenda for labour market-building and the attraction of ‘talented’ individuals and foreign investment. However, at the same time this celebratory rhetoric represents part of a wider effort to deflect political attention away from the socially and economically divisive impacts of global models of economic growth and physical development. There is little discussion of the ways in which planning frameworks, the ‘how’ of diversity policy, are helping to generate new separations in and beyond the city. Moreover, despite claiming that policy is pragmatic and non-ideological, the paper shows how diversity narratives have become an integral part of broader political projects to orientate the city’s economy towards the needs of a relatively small cluster of powerful economic sectors.

Then, in 2002, the UK government introduced a new progressive beer duty tax which enabled small-scale brewers to brew beer while paying less tax than their larger competitors, thus levelling the uneven financial playing field that economies of scale had created. This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made.

Using Klinenberg’s (Palaces for the people. Penguin, London, 2018) social infrastructure framework, and through a multiple case study approach, the chapter explores alternative approaches. First, it explores the support that public institutions need to give to these spaces, which imply a radical change in the planning system that departs from prioritising financial viability. Second, based on Sennett’s (Building and Dwelling.

This research aims to comprehend the role of inner-city canals, formed as branches of shipping canals, in the spatial accessibility and functional structure of two contemporary urban systems: London and Amsterdam. Both cities are major post-industrial hubs in Europe and their spatial development and socioeconomic conditions have been greatly influenced by waterways. While the canal network in Amsterdam was planned alongside street layout planning in the early 17th century, serving commercial purposes, canals were integrated into London’s pre-existing urban form mainly for transportation in the 19th century. The current situation in these cities is impacted by this disparity in three ways: (a) the potential use of canals in the urban transportation system; (b) the spatial accessibility of street networks; and (c) the correlations between street accessibility and land use patterns in canal neighbourhoods. The research employs analytical methods of space syntax, geographic information systems, and statistical techniques to create and apply integrated urban models, incorporating spatial network measures, retail density, and functional diversity for street segments, to compare various urban conditions. The research reveals the crucial finding that the incorporation of canals into the street system leads to a substantial increase in the mean values of street network accessibility in Amsterdam.

The assessments in many cases do not include the overall carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of different regeneration scenarios. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the methodology used to calculate the environmental impacts over the lifecycle of buildings. The current practice of building LCA is regularly conducted less effectively, and the uncertainties such as the limited scope of the framework and the variable system boundaries can produce considerably contrasting outcomes which can also be interpreted subjectively. This paper aims to explore a participatory approach to conducting LCA for options appraisal of estate regeneration schemes. The study employs a mixed methods design consisting of primary and secondary data collection and rapid ethnographic observations. The research includes a case study of a Housing Estate in London under threat of demolition. The community’s refurbishment and extension proposal has been developed through knowledge mobility and co-design workshops with the members of the community and University College London (UCL) design team, who are the stakeholders involved in conducting the participatory LCA. LCA of different regeneration and redevelopment scenarios have been explored. The results of the research provide convincing evidence in favour of the refurbishment scenarios over the redevelopment scenario. The findings can make a case for a participatory assessment framework for the evaluation of estate regeneration schemes and highlight the necessity of including other aspects beyond CO2 emissions in the assessment criteria. This study can assist researchers in preparing a framework for participatory integration of broader environmental and socio-economic impacts and including different stakeholders in decision-making over regeneration projects in different contexts.","Alton Estate Community

An effective monitoring tool that allows us to track the level of change is vital for controlling viral transmission, predicting travel and activity demand and, in the long term, for economic recovery. In this paper, we propose a set of Twitter mobility indices to explore and visualise changes in people’s travel and activity patterns, demonstrated through a case study of London. We collected over 2.3 million geotagged tweets in the Great London Area (GLA) from Jan 2019 –Feb 2021. From these, we extracted daily trips, origin-destination matrices, and spatial networks. Mobility indices were computed based on these, with the year 2019 as a pre-Covid baseline. We found that in London, (1) People are making fewer but longer trips since March 2020. (2) In 2020, travellers showed comparatively reduced interest in central and sub-central activity locations compared to those in outer areas, whereas, in 2021, there is a sign of a return to the old norm. (3) Contrary to some relevant literature on mobility and virus transmission, we found a poor spatial relationship at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level between reported COVID-19 cases and Twitter mobility. It indicated that daily trips detected from geotweets and their most likely associated social, exercise and commercial activities are not critical causes for disease transmission in London. Aware of the data limitations, we also discuss the representativeness of Twitter mobility by comparing our proposed measures to more established mobility indices. Overall, we conclude that mobility patterns obtained from geo-tweets are valuable for continuously monitoring urban changes at a fine spatiotemporal scale.",,,,,,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,,Technology and Computation ,European Union ,,,Discovery,

Several studies have been carried out to assess the (negative) impacts of noise on annoyance, particularly whilst working from home (WFH). The present study takes a step further by (1) investigating the positive and negative impacts of the “actual” acoustic environment on a range of activities, i.e., WFH, relaxation, physical, and sexual activities, and (2) identifying the characteristics of an “ideal” indoor soundscape. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of verbal descriptions collected from open-ended questions included in a survey administered in January 2021 to 464 respondents living in London, during the COVID-19 lockdown. The range of impacts in the actual scenario varied from no effect on task execution, to disruption, distraction, concern of disturbing others or being heard. Positive impacts included support of concentration, relaxation, motivation, freedom of sound expression, feeling of being connected to the surroundings and comforted by the presence of others, according to mechanisms described in the study. Negative appraisal could trigger coping strategies (e.g., controlling windows, playing music, wearing headphones) and behavioural changes (e.g., lowering the volume of the voice or music, muting oneself during call, changing workout type) that could in turn limit or enhance the freedom of behaviour, affect or foster wellbeing. Negative impacts were most frequently reported on WFH (by 55% of the participants), followed by relaxation activities (40.6%), sexual activities (30.1%), and home workout (20.1%). The ideal soundscape was described as a quiet, well-sound insulated environment, which guarantees access to positive sounds (i.e., natural sounds, music, urban background), thus resulting in privacy, intimacy, and a place where to express themselves without noise-related constraints. The study complements literature findings on housing design directions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing further evidence on the impacts of poor sound insulation at home, the potential benefits of nature-based solutions for positive indoor soundscapes, and opportunities for an activity-based design of domestic environments, inclusive of a broader set of home uses and household compositions.","1.

It further explores the potential of passive adaptations to improve indoor environmental conditions. Temperature and relative humidity data from continuous monitoring during summer 2019 were used to calibrate a building performance simulation model of the care home. Simulation outputs from two bedrooms and two lounges under the current (2019) and future climate (2080s with 90th percentile probability, high-emissions scenario under the UK Climate Projections 2009) were analyzed to evaluate the risk of indoor overheating and humidity discomfort, and to test the effectiveness of adaptation scenarios related to window operation and external shading. Results showed a high risk of exposure to high indoor temperature and low humidity under the current climate, which are expected to worsen in the future. Regarding the effect of passive adaptations, it was found that the highest potential decline in overheating and dry air incidence could be achieved through a combination of secured window opening at night and closing of external shutters during the day; yet this was compromised by an increased risk of humid air. Results further indicated that these strategies are not adequate under a future high-emissions climate scenario, which suggests that care homes need to combine passive and active ventilation to maintain indoor environmental comfort and reduce anticipated cooling demand.","1.

The spatial distribution across London was uneven, with a range from 1837.88 to 4391.79 per 10,000 people. During the whole COVID-19 control period, it was revealed that building attributes played a significant role in COVID-19 infection. It was noted that higher building density areas had lower COVID-19 infection rates in London. Moreover, a higher percentage of historic or flat buildings tended to lead to a decrease in infection rates. The percentage of residential buildings had a positive relationship with the infection rate. Variations in the infection rate were more sensitive to building type; in particular, the percentage of residents living in flats contributed the most to variations in COVID-19 infection rates, with a value of 2.5%.

In many cities, higher densities demand constructing taller buildings; and therefore, planners need to address their potential impact on the fabric of our cities (both individually and cumulatively) and the political and economic imperatives for cities to build ever taller. However, many existing policies and regulations are outdated and fail to address the nuances of density and its impact on placemaking. This chapter explores these tensions, focusing on the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea Opportunity Area in central London. The master plan for the new neighborhood envisages 25,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes. At the heart of the master plan is a massive increase in density through building tall buildings across the area.

There does seem a possibility that canal networks are associated with the growth of the world’s first cities and their spatial structure. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the canal structure in shaping the urban form through the city-growing process and its spatio-cultural outcomes in the city environment. It intends to perform a comparative analysis of Amsterdam and London, two diverse structures within their urban configurations and represent a different paradigm of the canal-street structure relationship. The study analyses the main spatial effect of differences in the canal structure overtime on the street configurations of the two cities. Diachronic spatial analysis has been undertaken for three periods for both cities: the 1850s, the 1950s, and the contemporary period. The study uses space syntax techniques as the main methodology; further, the spatial analysis results are geographically projected in GIS, and the statistical analysis is performed on the analysis results of historical maps to measure the physical effects of canal systems on the potential mobility in both cities. The Amsterdam and London analysis results show different examples in terms of street interconnections with canals in the formation of urban structures. While the urban form has been shaped with a top-down planning process in the form of a regular grid structure designed with canals in Amsterdam, the urban form of London is a dominant landbased spatial structure with regard to its movement potentials. Hence, Amsterdam shows an intermediate spatial structure between water- and land-based networks. On the other hand, places are locally and globally more accessible with land-based transportation systems in London.",,,,,,,,,,Construction and Engineering ,,,,Discovery,

Usually, interventions on rivers and riversides are focused on improving their ecological and hydrological aspects. However, to better define objectives for interventions and conservation of urban rivers we need a better understanding of how cities have shaped around rivers and the relationship between these elements and the whole city system. This paper argues that the current interaction between small rivers, urban form and socio-economic outcomes can be investigated through the analysis of the spatial network and land use patterns surrounding them. Using a statistical comparison of the spatial network, land use, demographic data and movement along with an assessment of historic maps, this study analysed the areas surrounding two small London rivers as well as four case studies. The study of the river corridors suggests that their urban form and function are strongly shaped by the connections with the city centre and historical land uses. At the same time, river areas are spatially segregated in comparison with their surrounding areas and they are crossed by routes that are important at city scale while local scale connections are more limited. In addition, the study found that spaces that were better utilised on riversides have a relationship with local centralities in their urban context providing more potential benefits for their communities. A better understanding of the characteristics of river areas and their relationship with the urban environment, particularly the level of accessibility of these natural areas, is relevant to improve policymaking and design interventions that can foster a better relationship between natural resources and the city.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,,,,Discovery,

Ms Martina Rotolo",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of the urban food system by interrupting global food chains and restricting human mobility, among others. This has impacted food security at the local level, with urban communities not been able to access food as before. In response, newly formed governance mechanisms and policies have emerged on the ground, disrupting existing governance frameworks. This paper examines such developments in London to understand how urban food is governed; and, what has been disruptive and how disruption in access to food has been governed during COVID-19. To do so, it draws on policy analysis, case study research and interview data. The paper finds disconnection between the national and metropolitan level and fragmentation between the metropolitan and municipal of urban food governance; with food security being addressed via people-focused approaches which are generously complemented by third sector and community-led initiatives.

As generators of governance innovation and indicators of the future city in each urban context, large-scale development projects have been interpreted within frameworks of “variegations” of wider circulating processes, such as neoliberalisation or financialisation. However, such projects often entail significant state support and investment, are strongly linked to a wide variety of transnational investors and developers and are frequently highly contested in their local environments. Thus, each project comes to fruition in a distinctive regulatory context, often as an exception to the norm, and each emerges through complex interactions over a long period of time amongst an array of actors. We therefore seek to broaden the discussion from an analytical focus on variegated globalised processes to consider three large-scale urban development projects (in Shanghai, Johannesburg and London) as distinctive (transcalar) territorialisations. Using an innovative comparative approach we outline the grounds for a systematic analytical conversation across mega-urban development projects in very different contexts. Initially, comparability rests on the shared features of large-scale developments – that they are multi-jurisdictional, involve long time scales, and bring significant financing challenges. Comparing three development projects we are able to interrogate, rather than take for granted, how wider processes, circulating practices, transcalar actors, and territorial regulatory formations composed specific urban outcomes in each case. Thinking across these diverse cases provides grounds for rebuilding understandings of urban development politics.","1. London Tenants’ Federation

On weekdays, when outdoor air pollution concentrations peak in the morning and in the late afternoon, people are usually either in non-domestic premises or on their way to/from non-domestic premises. Therefore, establishing the distributions of indoor air pollutant concentrations in non-domestic environments is essential to model human exposure to hazardous air pollution, especially for vulnerable populations, such as schoolchildren or patients in hospitals. In the Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure Model of the US Environmental Protection Agency, microenvironment pollutant concentrations are determined by outdoor pollutant concentrations, penetration of outdoor air indoors, proximity of the microenvironment to the outdoor pollutant emission source, and emission sources within microenvironments. Penetration of outdoor air to indoors is related to building characteristics, such as fabric air tightness and ventilation control, which can be affected by energy efficiency retrofits. The aim of this study is to predict the air penetration rate for London's school buildings (nursery, primary and secondary schools) and enhance our understanding of how energy efficiency improvements will impact indoor air quality modelling so as to prevent potential harmful exposure and improve existing retrofit techniques. The baseline statistics of building physics for school environments in London were aggregated from the building typologies and room uses from 3DStock Model to analyse the effect of built configurations on building ventilation and air tightness. The simulation results show that air change rates due to natural ventilation is low in Post-1980 school buildings, which means recently built or retrofitted buildings that are more airtight and energy efficient need to carefully maintain purpose provided ventilation to ensure adequate air exchange.",,,,,,,,,,Construction and Engineering ,,,,Discovery,

Dr Kayvan Karimi",,,Bartlett School of Architecture,"Transport development has become more and more important among all aspects of urban development in recent years. To accommodate the rising demand for daily travel and commutes, the public transport system, especially the rail system, is considered the better solution for sustainable mobility, instead of the road system for vehicles. Studies in urban morphology usually focus on the model of urban form without concerning the multi-dimensional network of public transport, whereas transport planning and engineering emphasise the capacity and travel demand within the road network, which disregards the spatial effect of the urban form. This research aims to bridge the gap between these two disciplines by developing an Integrated Urban Model (IUM), which combined various layers of urban information and dataset, including spatial network, land use and census. It seeks to identify the complex interrelationship between urban form networks and the socio-economic community by the synthetic analysis of the IUM. A multilevel multimodal network model has been built for the case of Greater London to combine the street network with the Metro/Rail network to investigate the network accessibility. In addition, this study applied space syntax theory and methodology as the primary approach to reveal the potential flow and movement pattern of the multilevel multimodal network. The result indicated that the multilevel network model with space syntax accessibility measurements could provide an interpretative overview of spatial distribution in both global and local scales. The IUM also allowed the spatial impact of public transport network to be uncovered through geodatabase modelling and spatial analysis.",,,,,,,,,,Technology and Computation ,,,,Discovery,

In particular, CWS can provide long-term measurements of urban heat and valuable information on spatio-temporal heterogeneity related to horizontal heat advection. In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering six years (2015–2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ)—a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by about 1.0 ∘C–1.5 ∘C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ± 0.96 ∘C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to 1.57 ∘C, on average and negatively by down to −1.21 ∘C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show the added value of CWS when considering future urban design.",,,,Government,UK Parliament Select Committee Publications,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,,Health,,,,Discovery,

Following 40 years of privatisation, these council-owned companies have been celebrated as a post-neoliberal municipal alternative to the hegemony of market-led urban policy. By developing commodified real estate and monetising rising land values, they promise to deliver well-designed housing, generate long-term fiscal rents, and secure local state autonomy. Drawing on in-depth empirical research, this paper develops a situated political economic critique of the limitations, contradictions, and risks of local housing companies in London. Framed as a “critical case”, providing insight into the politics of speculative urban provisioning and land value extraction, I argue that local housing companies represent a mode of municipal statecraft—a local state rentierism—that leans into and reproduces a political economy of financialisation and rentierism with potentially long-term implications for collective urban provisioning.","1.

Currently, the number of people over 60s in London is growing rapidly and is projected to increase to approximately two million by 2035. Aims: This research aims to examine walking accessibility to General Practitioners (GPs) for older people in Greater London, with a particular focus from a temporal perspective. Methods: Three different datasets were used for this study, namely: GP services data and data on GP Opening Times data from NHS Choices; the London Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) atlas; and the road network derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study uses on the cumulative method to calculate accessibility to GPs – and applies the vertical equity index to measure temporal equity. Results: Our results show that opening times have a significant impact on accessibility to health services for older people in London. Overall accessibility peaked at midday when 15.88% of areas have a low degree of accessibility. Additionally, our study classifies local authorities into five groups based on their performance on accessibility and vertical equity measurements. We found several districts with inadequate and unequal accessibility that can be identified as vulnerable areas. Conclusions: Gaining insights into the temporal variations in accessibility to GPs represents a key step towards providing optimal services.

This study aims to unpack the complexity of factors that influence the use of urban green space through the application of Systems Thinking. A qualitative mixed-method approach integrating System Dynamics with rapid ethnography was adopted to elicit the views of local residents in Thamesmead, London. A thematic analysis of interviews was undertaken to systematically map the causal relations between factors, which were compared to wider stakeholders’ views. Our findings highlight the relevance of dynamics and social influences on the use of green space, which include social interactions and stewardship, health conditions, availability of services and amenities. These are factors that are underexplored in the literature and, sometimes, overlooked in urban green space policy by decision-makers. We infer that attendance of urban green spaces requires time, which may be occupied in other practices determined by local conditions and needs. Expanding the spatial and temporal boundaries of investigation, wider than debates on ‘quality’, should, in our view, increase the chances of identifying critical influences and foster an increased use of green space.",,,,Think tank,New Economics Foundation,,,,,Planning and Policy,Wellcome Trust ,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),,Discovery,

In Dubai and Chongqing, AC was ubiquitous and central to life in the hotter months, although not for all socio-economic groups. AC enabled indoor work to proceed, but a restricted indoor life meant less exercise, less social interaction and health issues. Participants had over-adapted, not to heat but to cold indoor temperatures, which were uncomfortable for many. In London, AC was not yet used, but the purchase of AC was being contemplated. The London participants showed a range of behavioural adaptations to heat. To reduce dependence on AC, regulations and behaviour change interventions regarding AC settings should focus on acclimatisation to heat. Changes in societal patterns, such as workhours, and behavioural adaptations, such as informed use of shading, can help mitigate heat.

There is also evidence on the role played by blue and green space in improving physical and mental health, reducing the burden on the health care service. Yet from an urban planning and development view, natural capital may be considered a nice to have, but not essential element of urban design; taking up valuable space which could otherwise be used for traditional built environment uses. While urban natural capital is largely recognised as a positive element, its benefits are difficult to measure both in space and time, making its inclusion in urban (re)development difficult to justify. Here, using a London case study and information provided by key stakeholders, we present a system dynamics (SD) modelling framework to assess the natural capital performance of development and aid design evaluation. A headline indicator: Natural Space Performance, is used to evaluate the capacity of natural space to provide ecosystem services, providing a semi-quantitative measure of system wide impacts of change within a combined natural, built and social system. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life. Furthermore, the application of a SD approach captures key interactions between variables over time, showing system evolution while highlighting intervention opportunities.","Jimmy O'Keeffe

Using a discrete number of plan forms selected from case studies, a virtual risk database was populated with the results of a large number of parametric dynamic thermal simulations based on the EnergyPlus calculation engine and including aspects such as location within Greater London, orientation, fenestration size and natural ventilation, which are associated with known overheating risk factors. Alternative statistical meta-models were developed with both explanatory and predictive purposes, correlating the simulation input with the overheating risk predictions expressed according to multiple metrics. Results from multiple linear regression analysis show that while all factors considered are relevant towards determining the propensity to overheating, window opening and natural ventilation capacity are by far the strongest predictors among those considered. The implementation of machine learning algorithms is shown to improve the accuracy of the meta-model, producing very high coefficients of determination (R2) and lower prediction errors (RMSE). The development of a meta-model demonstrates the ability of returning accurate predictions with limited input, albeit with significant limitations. Possibilities of further improvements to the tool are briefly outlined, including the coupling with a User Interface for applicability in a design environment for early-stage design advice.","PRP

Perceived affective quality of indoor soundscapes has been assessed in the survey through a previously developed model, as the combination of two perceptual dimensions, one related to comfort (a comfortable – annoying continuum) and the other to content (a full of content – empty continuum). Part I of the study reported on differences in comfort, content, and soundscape appropriateness based on the activity performed at home during the lockdown, i.e. working from home (WFH) and relaxation. Moreover, associations between soundscape dimensions and psychological well-being have been highlighted. Part II of the study deals with the exploration of the influences of several acoustical, building, urban and person-related factors on soundscape dimensions and well-being. A mixed-method approach has been adopted by combining multivariate regression of questionnaire scores with the qualitative analysis of spontaneous descriptions given by respondents. Results showed that several sound sources, urban features, housing characteristics, working modes and demographic factors can influence (positively and negatively) soundscape dimensions differently depending on the task at hand. Notably, the perceived dominance of neighbours’ noises during relaxation, moderated by noise sensitivity, and the number of people at home were common factors negatively affecting both comfort and well-being, that partially explained the association between comfortable indoor soundscapes and better mental health. The discussion points out the importance of considering the different impacts that acoustical factors (e.g. sound typology), building (e.g., house size), urban (e.g., availability of a quiet side), situational (e.g., number of people at home), and person-related factors (e.g., noise sensitivity) can provide on building occupants depending on the specific activity people are engaged with at home and the opportunities to foster people’s well-being through building, urban and acoustic design.",Adult participants via Prolific participant pool,London,Data / questionnaire / method,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Health,Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE),European Research Council (ERC),,Discovery,

Recent models of hierarchical route planning use boundaries to plan efficiently first across regions and then within regions. However, it remains unclear which structures (e.g. parks, rivers, major streets, etc.) will form salient boundaries in real-world cities. This study tested licensed London taxi drivers, who are unique in their ability to navigate London flexibly without physical navigation aids. They were asked to indicate streets they considered as boundaries for London districts or dividing areas. It was found that agreement on boundary streets varied considerably, from some boundaries providing almost no consensus to some boundaries consistently noted as boundaries. Examining the properties of the streets revealed that a key factor in the consistent boundaries was the near rectilinear nature of the designated region (e.g. Mayfair and Soho) and the distinctiveness of parks (e.g. Regent's Park). Surprisingly, the River Thames was not consistently considered as a boundary. These findings provide insight into types of environmental features that lead to the perception of explicit boundaries in large-scale urban space. Because route planning models assume that boundaries are used to segregate the space for efficient planning, these results help make predictions of the likely planning demands of different routes in such complex large-scale street networks. Such predictions could be used to highlight information used for navigation guidance applications to enable more efficient hierarchical planning and learning of large-scale environments.",Jeremy Morley,"

This continuity raises several questions regarding the role of street network configuration and built form adaptability in supporting the long-term socio-economic sustainability of such places. Using contemporaneous maps, including Goad fire insurance plans and the maps and notebooks of Charles Booth’s poverty survey, we analyse street network configuration, building properties (size and height) and use to explore centrality as an historical process.

For each strategy, we develop specific scenarios related to building adaptations and test potential reductions on indoor overheating and pollutant exposures from outdoor sources (PM2.5), as well as on senior mortality through the CRAFT tool (Cities Rapid Assessment Framework for Transformation). We then pick the scenarios with highest impacts on mortality, aiming to formulate effective policy recommendations for Greater London. Preliminary results suggest that environmental policies related to the installation of shading could have the highest reduction in heat and pollution-related senior mortality, followed by moderate effects due to building insulation retrofits and the greening of roofs.

This paper examines the current and future risk of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings. Continuous monitoring of outdoor and indoor temperature in bedrooms, communal areas and offices in summer 2019 helped to establish the prevalence and intensity of overheating. Dynamic thermal simulation (EnergyPlusV8.9) of the two care settings assessed the potential for avoiding active cooling in future climate using passive solutions. In both care settings, indoor temperatures were observed to exceed 30 °C during daytime hours, significantly higher than the recommended 26 °C threshold of Public Health England. Although severity of overheating was lower in the older building, overheating was found to be prevalent and prolonged across both care settings with bedroom temperatures higher than lounges especially at night. Thermal simulation analysis showed that, with regards to temperature reduction and cooling load, nighttime ventilation was the single most effective passive solution for both buildings for the current climate, while a combination of night ventilation, external shading and high-albedo external walls was the most effective package solution. By the 2080s, air-conditioning was the most effective solution for reducing temperature, but also had the highest cooling load, highlighting the importance of balancing passive with active measures to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads.",Paul Wilkinson ,"Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK

",Bartlett School of Planning,"There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of “financialisation” to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive “business models”, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.","1.

In these changed social and acoustical contexts, we wanted to evaluate the perception of the indoor acoustic environment in relation to traditional and new activities performed at home, i.e., relaxation, and working from home (WFH). Taking London as a case study, the present paper presents the results of an online survey administered to 464 home workers in January 2021. The survey utilized a previously developed model for the assessment of indoor soundscapes to describe the affective responses to the acoustic environments in a perceptual space defined by comfort (i.e. how comfortable or annoying the environment was judged) and content (i.e., how saturated the environment is with events and sounds) dimensions. A mixed-method approach was adopted to reinforce result validity by triangulating data from questionnaires and spontaneous descriptions given by participants. In this first part of the study, the main objectives were: (1) evaluating differences in soundscape evaluation, in terms of comfort and content dimensions, based on the activity performed at home, (2) identifying appropriate conditions for WFH and relaxation, and (3) investigating associations between psychological well-being and indoor soundscapes. The results showed that the environments were perceived as more comfortable and slightly fuller of content when rated in relation to relaxation than for WFH, thus suggesting a stricter evaluation of the acoustic environment in the latter case. As regards the second objective, spaces that were more appropriate for relaxation had high comfort, whereas spaces appropriate for WFH resulted more private and under control, i.e. with high comfort and low content scores. Lastly, better psychological well-being was associated with more comfortable soundscapes, both for WFH (rs = 0.346, p < .0005), and relaxation (rs = 0.353, p < .0005), and with lower content while WFH (rs = −0.133, p = .004). The discussion points out the need of considering the implications of changed working patterns to rethink the design of soundscapes in residential buildings, also in relation to potential well-being outcomes that will be further investigated in the Part II of the study.",,,,,,Co-authorship with other partner(s),Co-authorship with research organization(s),,,Health,Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE),European Research Council (ERC),,Discovery,

UCL traces its beginnings to 1825, when a group of radical thinkers set about establishing a secular, non-residential metropolitan university. Its first architectural expression was the grand neoclassical building constructed in 1827–9 to designs by William Wilkins. Only the central block, portico and dome of Wilkins’s scheme were completed, yet successive wing extensions gradually formed a neoclassical quadrangle in Gower Street. A hospital was built in 1833–4, securing space for clinical teaching. UCL was initially denied a charter and precluded from awarding degrees, a complication that was resolved by the creation of the University of London as a separate examining body in 1836. Over the next century, UCL and its hospital expanded in a gradual and piecemeal manner in line with advances in education, technology and healthcare. UCL’s estate became increasingly complex, with a mixture of purpose-built blocks and the adaptation of buildings in the vicinity. A wealth of archival records, along with documentary sources and field investigation, has been used to examine the historic core of UCL’s estate in Bloomsbury. Institutional identity and aspirations are analysed in concert with practical influences on building projects, such as finances and functionality. The matter of identity also arises in the attribution of buildings to specific architects, which points to a tradition of enlisting professors such as Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Thomas Hayter Lewis, Thomas Roger Smith, Frederick Moore Simpson and Albert Richardson. In practice, their work was informed by multiple voices such as committee members, academic staff, external consultants and benefactors. This research addresses significant gaps in knowledge of the buildings, planning and development of UCL, while considering issues of identity, attribution and methodology pertinent to the study of architectural history.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,PhD Thesis

In this context, the present study investigates 8 flats in London to uncover if during a lockdown, (a) IAQ in the monitored flats deteriorated, (b) the patterns of window operation by occupants changed, and (c) more effective ventilation patterns could enhance IAQ without significant increases in heating energy demand. To this end, one-year’s worth of monitored data on indoor and outdoor environment along with occupant use of windows has been used to analyse the impact of lockdown on IAQ. Moreover, using on-site CO2 data, monitored occupancy and operation of windows, the team has calibrated a thermal performance model of one of the flats to investigate the implications of alternative ventilation strategies.

However, noise complaints reported by many local authorities were on the rise soon after the local lockdowns came into force. This research took Greater London in the UK as a case study. The overall aim was examining how noise complaints changed during the first stages of the lockdown implementation, during Spring 2020, both locally and at city scale, and how urban factors may have been influencing them. Noise complaint and urban factor datasets from the Government's publicly available data warehouse were used. The results show that during the COVID-19 lockdown the number of noise complaints increased by 48%, compared with the same period during Spring 2019. In terms of noise sources, complaints about construction (36%) and neighbourhood (50%) noise showed significant increases. Urban factors, including housing and demographic factors, played a more significant role than the actual noise exposure to road and rail traffic noise, as derived from the London noise maps. In detail, the change rate of noise complaints was higher in areas with higher unemployment rates, more residents with no qualifications, and lower house price. It is expected that this study could help government with allocating resources more effectively and achieve a better urban environment.",,,,,,,,,,Health,European Research Council (ERC),,,Discovery,

However, whereas a number of participatory MCA methods have been devised, the large majority of them seem to have enjoyed limited practical application and there are very few studies examining their effectiveness. In order to assess the presumed benefits and the potential drawbacks of such methods, this paper considers the case of the London Gateway Port and compares the actual planning and decision-making process of this port development programme with the results of a multi-actor multi-criteria appraisal exercise, involving several project stakeholders and experts.

The goal of the paper is to identify both how long it takes projects to go from idea to delivery, the relative time of different stages in the delivery process, and if projects with long timelines see physical or technological changes in their design. This work contributes to two ongoing discussions around the speed of infrastructure delivery, one that argues infrastructure moves too slowly and major efforts are needed to speed delivery and another that argues that good infrastructure thinking requires time to breathe and care should be taken in rushing through the delivery process. Detailed delivery timelines from initial proposal to construction or operation are developed for 26 transportation projects (16 in Toronto and 10 in London) between the years 2000 and 2018. For each project the timelines of inception, approval, planning, procurement, environmental assessment, construction and operational phases are identified and compared. Long informal gestation periods are identified for many projects, particularly for linear projects. In many instances the informal gestation period dwarfs the time projects spent in formal planning. This research highlights the need to expand the conception of timeliness of infrastructure delivery to include the lengthy periods of informal debate and planning that can span years and build up community expectations about the imminence of a project, even before it has received formal assessment or approval.",,,,,,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

Sam Griffiths",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"In recent years, the popularity of “resilience” has exploded in both academic and policy discourse. However, current transit resilience research only focuses on infrastructure resilience, giving little consideration to its interaction with passengers. Moreover, even for transit infrastructure resilience, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing resilience to reflect its scale-sensitive attributes. Therefore, to make cities and transit systems move from a vulnerable state to a more resilient one, this thesis seeks to advance our understanding of transit resilience performance from macro, meso and micro levels, focusing on the interactions between infrastructure and passengers. Additionally, this research is motivated by the need to bridge the theoretical gap between the transport network and complex network science disciplines. This research draws on a multiple-level framework to investigate stations' roles in maintaining London transit resilience at macro, meso and micro levels from a network perspective. At macro level, this research examines the overall transit resilience performance by using percolation modelling and fault tolerance. At meso level, resilience as a sub-network feature is examined by unravelling the travel structure and identifying the stations' roles in maintaining resilience within and beyond metropolitan levels through community detection and Z-P scores. This research evaluates each station’s role in maintaining resilience based on resilience and criticality matrix at micro level. In addition, this research seeks to answer for whom we should build resilience by including the transport equity analysis. In line with the conceptual framework, this research develops an R package1, ResilienceNet, which provides a reproducible and accessible tool to examine transit resilience at multiple levels. Three research findings can be derived from this research. First, the London transit is resilient against random disruption but relatively vulnerable to centrality-based attacks. The conventional network approach would understate or overstate the resilience performance at the macro level. Second, the empirical results justify the necessity to include an evaluation of resilience at the meso level, as the role of stations for ensuring resilience varies differently within and beyond sub-city communities. Third, at the micro-level, this research identifies 25 stations and some vulnerable groups, such as young and low-income groups, which are more likely to be affected by transit disruptions and need more attention. The results derived through analysis could be used to facilitate transport and urban planning at multiple levels, thus moving cities and transit systems from a vulnerable to a more resilient state.",,,,,,,,,,Construction and Engineering ,,,,Discovery,

Concurrent energy efficiency improvements to housing may modify indoor exposures to heat or cold, while population aging may increase susceptibility to temperature-related mortality. We estimate heat and cold mortality and energy consumption in London for typical (non-extreme) future climates, given projected changes in population and housing. Building physics models are used to simulate summertime and wintertime indoor temperatures and space heating energy consumption of London dwellings for ‘baseline’ (2005-2014) and future (2030s, 2050s) periods using data from the English Housing Survey, historical weather data, and projected future weather data with temperatures representative of ‘typical’ years. Linking to population projections, we calculate future heat and cold attributable mortality and energy consumption with demolition, construction, and alternative scenarios of energy efficiency retrofit. At current retrofit rates, around 168-174 annual cold-related deaths per million population would typically be avoided by the 2050s, or 261-269 deaths per million under ambitious retrofit rates. Annual heat deaths would typically increase by 1 per million per year under the current retrofit rate, and 12-13 per million under ambitious rates without population adaptation to heat. During typical future summers, an estimated 38-73% of heat-related deaths can be avoided using external shutters on windows, with their effectiveness lower for hotter summers. Despite warmer winters, ambitious retrofit rates are necessary to reduce typical annual energy consumption for heating below baseline levels, assuming no improvement in heating system efficiencies. Concerns over future overheating in energy efficient housing are valid but increases in heat attributable mortality during typical and hot (but not extreme) summers are more than offset by significant reductions in cold mortality and easily mitigated using passive measures. More ambitious retrofit rates are critical to reduce energy consumption and offer co-benefits for reducing cold-related mortality.",Paul Wilkinson,"Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK

Drawing on the Transport for London's newly released NUMBAT passenger origin-destination data, we unravel the travel structure and identify the stations' roles through network methods, community detection and Z-P scores. Our research has three results: First, London's passenger movement network can be subdivided into seven communities. The majority of stations within the same communities are geographically localised with few exceptions. Second, stations play distinct roles in handling the patterns of movement at different scales. Typically, there exists a set of stations that are significant for connecting between metropolitan communities, because the disruption of those stations will have a greater impact on overall network efficiency and affect a larger and more diverse group of passengers. Third, a classification of rail stations is developed based on stations' commitment at two scales.

A new methodology to quantify streetspace allocation is introduced using a geocomputational approach that allows both the processing of high-resolution topographic data over a large geographic extent and enables replicability for other cities. The correlation between streetspace allocation metrics and street network centrality at distinct scales is investigated across different geographic areas. These variables are then examined using cluster analysis to identify a typology of streets based on streetspace allocation and centrality. The results provide the framework for a design scenario study of inner London applying shortest-path analysis under an active travel prioritisation perspective. Streetspace statistics for London confirm the predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses. Most streets display standard residential street metrics, coinciding with traditional street classification schemes. Also, this serves to demonstrate quantitatively the spatially efficient organisation of the London street system with few wider distributors and many narrower local streets. In addition, through the combined examination of the streets' allocation and configurational metrics, it is possible to identify a new sub-type of local streets. The spatial arrangement of the streets segments types follows a centre-periphery pattern: wider and higher centrality streets are clustered at the city centre and show relative larger streetspace designated to pedestrians, corresponding with higher levels of estimated activity. On a prescriptive streetspace model of Inner London, the streetspace allocation of critical pathways is modified to illustrate how strategic scale street properties affect and are affected by design scale street parameters. The fine-grain physical metrics analysed here, not only can be useful to tackle a wide range of contemporary street related questions from urban environmental quality to the adoption of new technologies but also offer alternative analytical methods for street research, planning and design.",,,,,,,,,,Technology and Computation ,,,,Discovery,

This case study approach aimed to assess the presence of pollutants within low-energy apartments and to better understand the role of ventilation and seasonal variations in indoor air quality. The results indicate strong seasonal variations, driven by increased natural ventilation rates over the summer monitoring period. A combined metric for indoor and outdoor pollutants (Itot) suggests that the IAQ in the winter (Itot = 17.7) is more than twice as bad as that seen in the summer (Itot = 8.6). Formaldehyde concentrations were lower in the non-heating season, indicating increased ventilation rates more than offset increased off-gassing, in contrast to findings in other studies. However, increased summertime ventilation rates were observed to increase the proportion of outdoor pollutants entering the internal environment. This resulted in higher indoor concentrations of NO2 in the summer than the winter, despite significant reductions in outdoor concentrations.

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time–activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.","Sani Dimitroulopoulou Environmental Hazards and Emergencies Department, Public Health England United Kingdom","(51.5045224, -0.0221204)",Co-authorship with government partner(s),"Government

It has therefore become essential to understand how urban spatial structure changes, particularly with the increasingly available sources of ‘big data’. However, most studies mainly focus on delineating the spatial structure and its variations. Only a few have investigated the incentives behind the movement dynamics. To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels.","Menggiu Cao

Improving the energy efficiency of homes is a key objective to help reach this target, and the UK government's Clean Growth Strategy aims to get many homes up to an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Band of C by 2035. The relationship between home energy-efficiency and occupant health and wellbeing remains an area of ongoing research. This paper explores the nexus between home energy efficiency, energy consumption and self-reported health-an indicator of the general health and wellbeing of the population. We focus on Greater London through secondary data analysis. Energy-efficiency ratings and air infiltration rates of dwellings, derived from EPCs, were aggregated and matched to local area self-reported health and energy consumption data obtained from the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) Atlas database. Our regression model indicates that improving the energy efficiency (SAP) rating by 10 points for a typical home may reduce household gas consumption by around 7% (95% CIs: 2%, 14%). Beta regression finds a positive, but not statistically significant association between median SAP rating and the proportion of the population reporting 'good or very good' health when considering all Greater London LSOAs (z score = 0.60, p value = 0.55). A statistically significant positive association is observed however when repeating the analysis for the lowest income quartile LSOAs (z score = 2.03, p value = 0.04). This indicates that the least well-off may benefit most from home energy efficiency programs. A statistically significant positive association is also observed for the relationship between self-reported health and air infiltration rates (z score = 2.62, p value = 0.01). The findings support existing evidence for the predominantly naturally ventilated UK housing stock, suggesting that home energy efficiency measures provide a co-benefit for occupant health provided that adequate air exchange is maintained.",Greater London Authority’s (GLA) ,"51.507495,0.016223",Database,Government,The UK Government,Data Support ,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Health,Wellcome Trust ,,,Discovery,

To this end, the study draws from empirical data on infrastructure projects provision, including semi-structured interviews with a set of highly experienced and senior level informants with extensive knowledge and familiarity of infrastructure project planning and front-end decision making. The study is bounded with a focus on London, UK as an example of a complex, highly established global city with a great reliance on its infrastructure and a well-established projects ecology. Through inductive qualitative data analysis the study explores the role of infrastructure projects as solutions to policy problems, the multiple and complex nature of value in project definition and identifies three value levels, which are instrumental for project definition: local value, sector value and user value.

Based on a systematic literature review by van der Heijden (2019), this paper develops a simple framework to assess the state of ten enabling factors for effective urban climate governance, and applies it to low-carbon passenger mobility in London. Drawing on documentary evidence and a series of semi-structured expert interviews, it finds that London’s city authorities have a strong capacity for autonomy, stakeholder participation, local leadership and coordination on climate action and mobility, of which they make extensive use. The national legal and political framework remains broadly supportive following the UK’s departure from the EU, but multi-level co-ordina-tion is thin, and funding issues have intensified conflict over political jurisdiction since the pandemic began.

This paper presents a methodology enabling estimation of air pollutants and CO_{2} for each street segment in the Greater London area. This is achieved by applying a hybrid probabilistic classification–regression approach on a set of variables believed to affect traffic volumes and utilizing emission factors.

We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2% of all properties in London, and up to 7% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.",Zahratu Shabrina ,"King’s College London (51.511612,-0.116253)",Co-authorship with academic partner(s),"Aggregator

Little is currently understood about the collective transport impacts of such activity in urban centres and to what extent this poses challenges for transport policymakers. The paper provides an international review of market growth in this sector together with insight into key topics associated with its freight delivery operations in urban areas. Using a substantial database of meal deliveries made in London by a major platform provider, this paper quantifies the operational performance of these deliveries and their transport and environmental impacts. On average, 9.6 deliveries were undertaken by a DD daily, with each taking 25 min from pickup to delivery with an average trip length, from restaurant to customer of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) a DD travelling 41.3 km (25.7 miles) in total per day, The analysis of the case study indicates the relative transport inefficiency of these on-demand meal deliveries compared to other forms of urban road freight (with a meal delivered by car being responsible for approximately 1300 times the distance travelled by an articulated HGV operation per tonne delivered). It also highlights the far greater GHG emissions and transport intensity associated with meals deliveries by cars and petrol mopeds compared to bicycles (emitting 5 and 11 times more GHGs per meal delivered than bicycles, respectively). The transport and GHG emissions intensity of these meal deliveries raises important policy issues, especially given therapid growth in the provision of, and demand for, these services internationally, Based on the review and analysis, the paper provides a discussion of the key issues that urban policymakers around the world need to take account of in relation to this fast-growing sector including vehicle fuel sources, road safety, trip generation rates and their impacts on local residents, together with recommended actions.","Julian Allen

Yet, little is known about how planning policy can best support the retention and growth of urban manufacturing. To advance this agenda, this article proposes that we need a better understanding of industrial building typologies and resultant urban form. Using concepts developed by Julienne Hanson to analyse residential morphologies undergoing transformation under modernism, we apply these concepts to investigate the industrial, mixed-use contexts in two areas of London with concentrations of urban manufacturing—Hackney Mare Street and Old Kent Road. The research presented examines how both areas have evolved historically to produce distinctive urban tissues and a range of industrial building typologies. The article reveals that, despite territorial similarities in the late 19th century, the mixed land uses and smaller plot sizes of Hackney Mare Street have allowed for a more resilient development pattern, whereas the greater separation of land uses, large plot sizes, and inward-facing development in the Old Kent Road has facilitated its reimagination for large-scale regeneration. We conclude that greater attention needs to be paid to the relationship between urban manufacturing and built urban form if policies that aim to protect or support the revival of manufacturing in cities are to avoid negative unintended consequences.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

And yet, there is growing evidence that informal practices are also present in Northern cities, especially those traditionally considered ‘successful’ or ‘developed’ such as London, in which housing pressures are most acute. This paper, drawing on detailed policy analysis and qualitative in-depth interviews, uses the example of London to examine the rise of informal housing, the ways in which it is both represented and conceptualised as a ‘problem’ of governance to be tackled, and its institutionalisation into programmes of enforcement. It focuses on the emergence of a phenomenon known as ‘beds in sheds’, or the construction of informal housing in between existing buildings. By discussing a planning issue that is generally associated with the Global South in a Global North context, the paper engages with writings on postcolonial theory. It adopts a nexus approach to examine how the issue is embedded within particular configurations of social, political, economic and cultural circumstances. The evidence indicates that the ways in which the problem is framed and understood are underpinned by colonialist views that see migrants and their socio-ethnic communities as agents of informality, whose removal or sanction will ‘solve’ the problem. The paper concludes with reflections on broader debates on informality in urban studies.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),,,Discovery,

Despite government policies promoting accessible transport for everyone, the needs of VIP are not well addressed, and journeys can be very difficult to negotiate. Journey requirements can often differ from those of other categories of people on the disability spectrum. Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the journey experience of VIP using public transport. Semi-structured interviews conducted in London are used. The results show that limited access to information, inconsistencies in infrastructure and poor availability of staff assistance are the major concerns. Concessionary travel, on the other hand, encourages VIP to make more trips and hence has a positive effect on well-being. The findings suggest that more specific policies should be introduced to cater to the special needs of particular disabilities rather than generalising the types of aids available. It is also concluded that the journey experience of VIP is closely related to an individual's independence and hence inclusion in society.",,,,,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),,,,Health,,,,Discovery,

In the building sector, a warming climate will significantly affect building heating and cooling loads, as well as building occupant health, comfort and wellbeing. School buildings in the UK, in particular, might face additional challenges, such as indoor overheating risks due to high internal gains in classrooms, and their current reliance on natural ventilation, which might offer limited cooling capacity in the future. This paper presents a secondary school building stock indoor environment modelling framework for London. The aim of the present study is to explore the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on schoolchildren’s cognitive performance levels. Using the PDSP (Property Data Survey Programme) dataset and a basic set of school building archetypes for London, a parametric stock modelling framework was developed. Weather files based on existing Test Reference Years (TRY) incorporating the UK Climate Projections 2009 scenarios were used. This study provides a detailed assessment of school building stock indoor thermal performance and students’ cognitive performance. It was found that building thermal properties and ventilation rates can function as reliable predictors of students’ cognitive performance, and their impacts were quantified in this study. A sensitivity analysis aiming to identify the relative importance of these factors will be conducted as part of ongoing research.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Discovery,

It undertakes feasibility work to identify possible causes of overheating across a range of care home types and evaluate the current and future potential of indicative passive solutions. The summertime thermal environments of five case study care homes were monitored and their physical, technical and occupancy profiles were established through surveys. The data was inputed in the EnergyPlus V8.9 dynamic thermal simulations via the DesignBuilder Graphical User Interface. Future overheating risks and their reduction potential through the use of passive strategies were tested under a set of representative climate change scenarios, during a five-day heatwave period. The dynamic thermal simulation analysis indicated that older buildings with higher heat loss and thermal mass capacities are likely to benefit more from the application of high albedo materials rather than external shading methods, whereas newer and highly insulated buildings seem to benefit more from higher ventilation rates and appropriate external shading systems. Night ventilation emerged as the single most impactful passive technique for all building types. This feasibility work has developed novel methods, knowledge and insights that will be helpful in understanding how to enable care settings in the UK to become resilient to rising heat stress. This is one of the first systematic attempts to build a set of dynamic thermal models of care homes in the UK.","1. Paul Wilkinson

Focusing on three questions, this study a) captures the diversity of window operation across the flats using three metrics, b) identifies and ranks the driving factors behind the operation of windows, and c) discusses the diversity of these driving factors using univariate logistic regression models. Notably, the results suggest that, apart from the commonly studied factors such as air temperature and humidity, pollutant parameters can also explain the operation of windows by occupants. Furthermore, the diversity observed in the occupants’ window operation behaviour and its driving factors discourages the reliance of future modelling efforts on aggregated datasets that can suppress the inter-occupant diversity.

During this period the established Jewish community of the city benefited from political emancipation, but this was not the case for the recently arrived impoverished Jewish migrants from Eastern Europe. The spatial constitution of religious practice also differed across the city: in a study of two sample areas, one in the more prosperous West End which, other than an isolated case in the impoverished district of Soho, had purpose-built buildings fronting the street; and another in an area of Whitechapel, in the East End, which was dominated by smaller ad hoc arrangements – one-room or adapted premises, shtiebels – serving a wider communal and social purpose, similar to the practice of the old country. A comparative space syntax isovist analysis of the visibility of synagogue façades from surrounding streets found that while, in the West End, most synagogues had a limited public display of religious practice by this time, East End prayer houses remained visible only to their immediate, Jewish majority surroundings. The paper proposes that the amount of synagogue-street visibility corresponds to the stage of growth in both social acculturation and political confidence.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

In this paper we analyse the ways in which authorities in two global cities, London and Toronto, have drawn on corporate, public management, strategies as their principal mode of diversity governance. In both we see a shift in policy making as a conscious attempt to reframe and re-imagine cities as corporate-like structures that can be conceptualised, represented, and managed through the lens of diversity management. In both cities specific representations of the city and its populations are curated to fulfil wider policy objectives. City governments present both as iconic centres of diversity, super-diversity or hyper-diversity, that embody and represent an era of progressive globalisation and new forms of contemporary cosmopolitan living. The presence of diversity is celebrated and seen a key component of ‘success agendas’. This paper is based on empirical evidence derived from a policy-oriented research project in both cities. Policy analysis and critical discourse analysis are conducted in both cities on the basis of review of policy documents at national, local and community scales, and interviews with policy makers. The paper first frames diversity as a technology of description, where we explain how diversity has become a curation strategy in public management within the framework of growing mobility of management frameworks and shifts in framing diversity in urban policies.

Young people are typically less involved in research about their prosperity than adults. Their views and experiences are therefore less likely to be considered in policy decisions than adults’. However, young people – and particularly adolescents between 14-24 years old – are significantly affected by societal transformation, and are capable of reflecting on and responding to that transformation. We outline a study conducted with young people in Hackney who are mostly in mid-adolescence (between 14-17 years old). Hackney is a borough in east London which has undergone significant social and economic transformation. We draw out the main factors which young people said influenced their ability to live a good life in Hackney and discuss their views of the London Prosperity Index. We argue that there are structural differences and value differences which affect how young people understand prosperity, and which impact their capacity to lead a good life in places which are changing significantly. We conclude by establishing the need for a Youth Prosperity Index, to complement the Prosperity Index and related indexes, which focus on adults’ experiences and values.

This history leads to an account of the development, since 2009, of the 3DStock method for modelling complete building stocks, both domestic and non-domestic. The paper explains how 3DStock models are built and the data sources used. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship of premises (the floorspace occupied by organisations) to buildings. Energy use may be metered at the level of premises, buildings or groups of buildings. Representing the patterns in which premises relate to buildings is therefore crucial to the modelling process, and in particular to the precise measurement of energy intensities. Applications of 3DStock models in building science and policy tools are reviewed, including the London Building Stock Model (LBSM), delivered to the Greater London Authority (GLA) in 2020. This ‘digital twin’ can be used for the monitoring, simulation and analysis of the building stock. Implications for research and policy are discussed, particularly for energy epidemiology, density, high-rise buildings, retrofit potential, energy-use intensity and benchmarking. Data are in place to extend 3DStock modelling to the whole of England and Wales. / Policy and practice relevance: The models can be used to assess energy demand in large numbers of buildings in relation to a range of variables, including built form, age, construction and activities. Poorly performing buildings can be identified, and the potential for retrofit—including renewable technology installations—evaluated using the same variables plus information contained in Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). Policies for addressing fuel poverty can be evaluated by making links to confidential socioeconomic data on occupants. In conjunction with a dynamic building energy-simulation tool, scenarios can be investigated for retrofit, the potential for renewables and issues in demand-side management. Additional uses are in the precise measurements of density and of the three-dimensional character of the urban fabric. There could be applications in public health, the modelling of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and the tracking of material flows. 3DStock models might also be integrated with digital twins of infrastructure systems and networks.",Agnieszka Griffin at the Greater London Authority (GLA),"51.507495,0.016223",,"Think tank

We conducted this research at local authority level rather than region level to offer a clearer insight into the relationship between house price variation and travel time to London, concentrating especially on the period post the 2008 financial crisis. Results show that local authorities with shorter travel tomes to London generally have greater house prices increases, but with some exceptions.

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. METHODS: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007–2016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). RESULTS: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036–1.043 per 1 °C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026–1.039 and 1.043, 1.037–1.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an important contribution towards informing city-level climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","Peninah Murage

The plan was quickly rejected as impracticable and Wren’s creative energy went into the design of St Paul’s Cathedral and more than fifty parish churches. But his scheme was memorialized by his son and grandson as a scandal of lost opportunity, a noble vision ‘unhappily defeated by faction’. Widely reproduced by print-makers, it gained iconic status, influencing street improvement in eighteenth-century London, nineteenth-century public health reform, late-Victorian advocacy of municipal autonomy, and twentieth-century planning controversies including the Paternoster Square redevelopments of 1955 and 2000. The paper shows how archival research disproving the received narrative of Wren’s plan opened the way for different understandings both of the planning legacy of reconstruction after the Great Fire, and of his own accomplishments as a Renaissance architect working within a mediaeval street plan.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

The work almost entirely concealed the mid eighteenth-century core of the hospital and extended its footprint beyond its immediate grounds, creating a sprawling medical complex on the south side of Whitechapel Road. The transformative effect of Plumbe’s work was centred on procuring sanitary and functional interiors. During an association that spanned thirty-five years, Plumbe designed well-ventilated wards, bright operating theatres, and highly specialized departments. Nurses’ homes were planned to preserve discipline and respectability, forming a cluster of tall dormitory blocks connected by covered bridges.

Therefore, it is worth seeking a simple and effective approach to measure the processes of gentrification, which enables comparative studies to be conducted across different cities around the world. Using six sets of thematic data from 2001 and 2011 at the neighbourhood level, this study proposes five types of gentrification and displacement by using Chapple and Zuk’s theoretical framework. London was selected as a case study. The results show that gentrification was sweeping in many ways during the 2000s in London, particularly in Inner East London. Some areas in North West London are identified as vulnerable neighbourhoods at risk of displacement and gentrification. Furthermore, it was found that most of the neighbourhoods experiencing ongoing displacement are concentrated in Outer London and Inner South London. The typology provides a useful starting point for planners and policymakers to gain deeper insights into the progress of gentrification in London. Additionally, this work can serve as an example to illustrate the potential for using similar types of open source code and census data to estimate the degree of gentrification in other cities.",,,,,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

Consequently, the UK government announced its intention to ban diesel vehicles by 2040 to achieve a sustainable zero-carbon road transport system. Since no empirical studies have used a bottom-up approach to seek Londoners’ views, it is therefore worth investigating the public opinion regarding this forthcoming ban. This paper aims to fill this research gap by taking London as a case study. A survey was designed, and fieldwork was conducted to distribute questionnaires to Londoners. Completed questionnaires were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings revealed that the majority of Londoners would be in favour of the ban if they were sufficiently exposed to the appropriate sources of information and were favourably disposed towards environmental protection measures. The results also showed that Londoners were more likely to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) if they were offered generous incentives and encouraged to use scrappage schemes. The present study makes a strong case for enforcing the ban well before 2040. The significance of this research is to provide clearer signals regarding the future of diesel vehicles, which in turn will strengthen the EV policy and uptake.","Mengqiu Cao

Ideas of urban conservation have evolved from monument restorations to Historic Urban Landscape (HUL). HUL emphasises connecting urban heritage to its city, but it lacks a platform for providing a direct connection. Spatial networks in space syntax theory translate non-discursive dynamic urban contexts to numerical and comparable systems. This paper argues that spatial networks can provide an effective platform for studying urban heritage in a closer link with all other aspects of the city. It takes the historic core in London as a case study. By using the techniques of spatial network modelling, the research investigates how the spatial characteristics match the heritage characteristics in the historic core. Heritage networks in this research are a device that aggregates the heritage data on the spatial model and presents it in a numerical, connected system. Furthermore, high heritage-weighted clusters are defined through a statistical analysis of the heritage networks. The research shows that these clusters have different spatial and potential movement patterns. With the spatial network approach, heritage conservation can be integrated with other planning and urban design tasks and can provide a more robust evidence for an enhanced urban conservation initiative. The approach employed in this paper is developed and tested for London. However, this methodology can be applied to any other city in the world, wherever urban heritage is an important element of urban planning and design.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

The method was successful in identifying isolated local area but were unsuccessful in identifying local area that was less driven by the grid but more from other urban factors. This research attempts to address this problem by embedding street characteristics in community detection to define Street Character Weighted Local Area (St-W-LA). The idea is that street neighbourhoods are not only defined by the topology of the street network but also by the morphology of the built form. In particular, we adopted Spacemate Building Density Metric in defining Density-based local area for Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Space Syntax angular choice metric in defining angular-choice-based (note. for simplicity reasons we term this betweeness-based) local area for London in the UK. We compared the results of the community detection with user defined local area through visual analysis. In general, we found the weighted and the unweighted street-based local areas to be similar. This suggests that neighbourhood characteristics (morphology) follow neighbourhood topology where areas that were built in similar times with similar density and building type were also better connected internally. However, we also found notable differences between the two methods where the weighted local area seems better in capturing the user defined local area in more continuous grids. Further empirical research employing mental map studies and intra-cluster analysis are needed to validate the method.",,,,,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Other,,,,Discovery,

London is the type of city that actively attracts and interacts with tourists. Tourists are, almost by definition, a group of “spatial users” that do not live and work within the city in the long term. The way they move and navigate through the city relates to their plans and destinations, and it is not always easy to distinguish such a group from other spatial users. Therefore, it requires a special effort to study their movement patterns and to identify the relationship between the group and space. Instead of using traditional on-site observations, this research has explored a new method for collecting and converting social media platform data into movement patterns using the data from Flickr. // Comparing with traditional data-collecting methods, the proposed method can cover a wider territory (5-km radius) and period (5 years), and most importantly, it collects users’ movement data without interfering with their regular activities, which might collect more natural movement results. The essential concept of movement data conversion is to arrange the geo-tagged photos of each Flickr user per day by the time sequence during their itinerary. The sets of sorted photos will reflect the visit order each user has gone through. The geographical data of the arranged photos can be converted into the topological travel routes. Finally, the routes will be mapped onto the base map using the proposed method. The collected data from the Flickr platform provide a wide range of information from static content to movement flow. These data are crucial in studying tourist activities and their related space.",,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,Discovery,

Phil Symonds",,,"Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources","In the UK, there has been an increase in the number of loft conversions, driven by demands for increased floor areas of dwellings to accommodate more individuals or increase property values. While rooms directly underneath roofs are known to have increased overheating risks, there is little research available that quantifies this risk, and how to mitigate it cost-effectively. This paper seeks to evaluate overheating risks in loft conversions, using integrated environmental solutions virtual environment to dynamically simulate indoor temperatures in a semi-detached dwelling in London, UK, under current and future (2050s and 2080s medium and high emissions) climate scenarios. Adaptive overheating risk and energy consumption are calculated with and without passive overheating adaptations that reduce solar gains, increase ventilation, or add thermal insulation. Marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) are then used to select the most cost-effective adaptations based on installation and ongoing energy consumption costs. Results estimate 11,340–12,210 more summertime Category I overheating degree-hours for the loft than conventional bedrooms in the dwelling under the current climate; total category I loft overheating degree-hours may increase to 20,319 by 2080. While external shutters and night-purge ventilation were the most effective at reducing overheating degree-hours (96% and 89%, respectively), the most cost-effective solutions considering capital and ongoing costs are ventilation strategies, including night-time purge ventilation, advance ventilation and cross ventilation. Passive adaptations are not capable of eliminating overheating entirely, and by the 2080s active cooling is likely to be required to maintain comfortable indoor conditions in lofts. Practical application: Converted lofts – present in 5.8% of English and 10.8% of London dwellings – are at significantly elevated risk of high indoor temperatures relative to conventional rooms. Passive adaptations such as ventilation and shading can effectively mitigate loft overheating until around 2080, after which active measures become necessary. When capital and ongoing costs are considered, the most cost-effective heat mitigating adaptations are night and advance ventilation and internal curtains/blinds. Heat mitigating adaptations for converted lofts should become mandatory, and such spaces should not be occupied by the vulnerable or elderly during hot weather.",,,,,,,,,,Construction and Engineering ,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Discovery,

However, most recent research has focused on the environmental and economic aspects of developing sustainable urban environment, whilst largely neglecting the social aspects. Contemporary political thinking in the UK often disregards the potential of the urban infrastructure to improve social equity. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of transport infrastructure on a variety of social measures, in an empirical and ideologically unbiased fashion, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We selected “Tramlink” as a case study: a light-rail system in the London Borough of Croydon which began operation in 2000. We used quantitative methods, including advanced spatial statistics, to produce a more detailed analysis of social equity than has been previously published. This acknowledges that determining localised issues can produce more informed and effective policy interventions. Our results demonstrate that the physical properties of transport infrastructure and the non-physical attributes of society, in combination, help to create opportunities for individuals to succeed.

Social equity in itself is a difficult term to define, while it is still more challenging to quantify the contribution that transport investment might make to improving social equity. Four key findings are derived from the research analysis. First, it is revealed that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, not just the areas of social deprivation previously found mainly in East London. Second, it is found that there are statistically significant differences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, such as gender, age, ethnic origin, marital status, incumbent population, employment, personal income, housing tenure, and car ownership; and also across different neighbourhoods in London. Third, the results show that functionings and capabilities differ according to an individual’s socio-economic characteristics and geographical location, meaning that both the opportunities to participate in life and also the actual activities themselves differ in the case of Beijing. This is an important distinction that the Capabilities Approach (CA) offers, and it is useful to consider if the potential for achieving improved social equity is to be realised. Finally, the findings show that socio-economic characteristics, travel factors, built environment features, and attitudes/perceived needs play significant roles in station area residents’ choice of transport mode, meaning that the results are mainly in line with previous studies, although some propensities associated with mode choice vary between London and Beijing. Factors relating to social equity are also taken into account and reveal a significant relationship with transport mode choice.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers issued Technical Memorandum 59 (TM59) with the aim of achieving consistency in the modelling processes followed for the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. However, as each tool’s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus influence the overheating risk assessment in flats, while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications. Practical application: Technical Memorandum 59 issued by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers may be widely adopted within the industry to assist the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. This work suggests that the choice of building performance simulation tool can greatly influence the predicted overheating risk. Furthermore, the differences identified in the modelling of heat transfer processes could also impact other modelling applications. Following these results, the need for detailed empirical validation studies of naturally ventilated homes has been highlighted.","Anastasia Mylona

This perhaps reﬂects the heightened levels of social inequity in cities and the concern over diﬀerential access to transport and participation in activities. This paper considers these issues by applying the Capabilities Approach to transport, in order to examine an individual’s opportunities to travel and engage in activities (capabilities) and their actual day to day travel and engagement in activities (functionings). London is selected as a case study using analysis from three Underground stations on the Jubilee Line Extension. The ﬁndings show that there are statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, and also across diﬀerent neighbourhoods in London. It is argued that unless local residents’ potential travel opportunities and actual activities, and the gaps between them, are better understood and responded to, the problem of transport-related social inequity is likely to persist in London. Therefore, we suggest that the ﬁndings from this research, including the multi-dimensional social indicators and understanding of the barriers to accessibility, could be used alongside existing approaches such as accessibility planning.","Mengqui Cao

The model aims to minimise the total travelling time by scheduling a vehicle’s routing and the driver’s walking sequence when making deliveries, taking decisions on parking locations into consideration. The model is a variant of the Clustered Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows, in which the sequence of visits within each cluster is required to form a closed tour.

This paper focusses on this problem of measurement and reports on the findings from a rigorous testing scheme carried out to quantify air and surface mould concentrations and particle counts within 71 rooms from 64 properties in North London, some with and some without visible mould. The aim was to investigate the potential of passive and active air sampling strategies (sampling from still and actively mixed air, respectively) to explain visible mould, and understand how home/room characteristics correlate with the obtained readings. Airborne mould levels were quantified using an Andersen sampler (passively and actively), as well as by a chemical method based on the quantification of the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity (actively), which was also used to quantify surface mould. The mould levels were then correlated against physical characteristics of the tested homes/rooms, collected by means of survey sheets developed as part of this study. The findings did not reveal any independent variable governing all or most of the response variables, but a complex analysis suggested that whether it is a house or a flat could depict mould levels in the air and on the surfaces. It was also shown that a robust testing protocol should combine air and surface based methods, and an active air sampling strategy leads to a more accurate appraisal of airborne mould levels. Finally, the results showed that while there is some correlation between visible mould (and other moisture induced problems such as condensation) and measured air mould concentrations, lack of visible mould within a room does not necessarily mean low air mould concentrations, and thus one should not rely solely on visual inspection.","Hector Altamirano

If pubs, generally, are important to the social life of neighbourhoods, LGBTQ+ venues function as vital infrastructure for these groups, providing spaces of care and community against wider contexts of oppression and violence.

Nicola Livingstone",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"In the wake of the global financial crash of 2007–2008, many governments have sought to streamline their post-war planning systems and encourage faster project delivery. Expedited decision-making is equated with efficiency and the meeting of broader growth objectives, whereas slower and more complex forms of engagement are presented as an impediment and a governmental problem to be solved through reform. For critical authors such as Weber, such approaches are fraught with danger. The core objective of planning systems should, conversely, be focused on the production of ‘slow cities’, in which decision-making times allow time for proper democratic and judicial-technical oversight of development processes. Slow planning, it is claimed, can limit the negative impacts of rapid development on urban built environments and communities. In this paper, we draw on research in London to examine the relationships between the temporalities of planning, project outcomes and the politics of time. We argue that within urban studies there needs to be a stronger emphasis on the temporal dimensions of governance and the politics of time. We highlight the conditions in and through which temporal resources are deployed strategically in urban planning and assess the ways in which powerful, reflexive and time-resourced developers and investors use planning timeframes to boost returns over the longer term. We conclude by setting out agendas for future research and for more variegated and contextualised explorations of fast and slow planning processes.",,,,Government,UK Parliament Select Committee Publications,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

Phase two constructs, validates and analyses a system dynamics model, and then proposes policies. Results show promise for reducing water consumption through efficient appliances. However, efforts must be placed in their development. Moreover, installation of metering devices can reduce water consumption, but this effect weakens over time. Occupancy continues to be a major factor influencing water consumption.

In recent years, a considerable amount of work has been developed around the use of social media data, most of which focusses on mining the content, with comparatively less attention given to the location information. Furthermore, what aggregated scale spatial patterns show still needs extensive discussion. This paper proposes a tweet-topic-function-structure framework to reveal spatial patterns from individual tweets at aggregated spatial levels, combining an unsupervised learning algorithm with spatial measures. Two-year geo-tweets collected in Greater London were analyzed as a demonstrator of the framework and as a case study. The results indicate, at a disaggregated level, that the distribution of topics possess a fair degree of spatial randomness related to tweeting behavior. When aggregating tweets by zones, the areas with the same topics form spatial clusters but of entangled urban functions. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering generates a clear spatial structure with orders of centers. Our work demonstrates that although uncertainties exist, geo-tweets should still be a useful resource for informing spatial planning, especially for the strategic planning of economic clusters.",Chen Zhong,"Department of Geography, King's College London, WC2R 2LS, UK (51.51323921810703, -0.11708640373538458)",Co-authorship with academic partner(s),,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Planning and Policy,Tsinghua University Open Fund ,,,Discovery,

Its founder Charles Robert Ashbee had a strong socialist commitment to the advancement of equality through understandings of a common built environment. The Survey’s first monograph, subtitled an ‘Object Lesson in National History’, was devoted to Trinity Hospital, almshouses on the Mile End Road. It interwove architectural and social history in a preservation campaign that emphasised the social value of historic buildings. In 1910 the Survey was taken under the wing of the London County Council (LCC) where its purposes knitted well with the dominant Progressive party’s determination to raise historical consciousness as a counter to the interests of private property. After the Second World War the LCC took the Survey back to its roots to re-engage with development and destruction. An early fruit of this was a volume devoted to Spitalfields (volume 27, 1957). Not only did this bring attention to the district’s previously uncelebrated eighteenthcentury houses, but it also broadened to account for humble and recent buildings, even those of the inter-war period. In 2016 the Survey once again returned to East London, to work towards publication on Whitechapel, a place currently witnessing huge change. An innovation for the Survey is an interactive map-based website (‘Survey of London – histories of Whitechapel’ http://surveyoflondon.org). This allows the public to contribute knowledge, memories and images to research on the area, a melding of ‘official’ and ‘unofficial’ history that takes the Survey onto new methodological ground.

In the vast literature on this topic, relatively little attention has paid to the demand side, and in particular, the role of unregulated investment demand. We argue that this demand is fuelled by the mortgage market, and encouraged implicitly by government policies, as a growth model for the UK economy through housing equity withdrawal, and as a privatised pension provision strategy. The financial industry, left at its own devices to create and allocate money in the form of debt in line with its short-term remit of maximising stakeholder value, issues loans and allocates it towards the highest expected return-to-risk ratio. The intrinsically low risk of housing mortgages gives housing a permanent advantage in absorbing credit, if remained unregulated. This allocation, besides being undemocratic, is not in the long-term interest of economic stability and equality. In this paper, we present an initial model built on existing literature and statistical data that serves as a first step towards an integrated model of London’s house price dynamics since 1980, with a particular focus on the role of the financial markets. The model, even though at an early stage, shows promise in endogenously replicating past trends in some variables key to the current housing crisis. A more comprehensive qualitative model is also presented in the form of a causal loop diagram, which will be the basis of further refinement of the formal quantitative model.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

The present paper introduces a method to simulate and represent the mismatch surfaces in the perceptions of different social groups that can be compared through visualization using a standard balanced plane. The three-dimensional visualization of the results of the London metropolitan area demonstrates that the commuting advantages – higher levels of commuting affordability through various transport systems, and the configuration of the land-use system – lead to larger ‘flooded areas’ under the balanced plane ( = 0) and a more scattered pattern of the job centres from the central city to suburban areas for people in higher managerial occupations. Evaluation of these surfaces further show the east–south and north–south divisions perceived by occupations.",,,,,,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,,Planning and Policy,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),,,Discovery,

Robin Hickman",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"This paper investigates the combined problem of high car dependence and housing affordability, in view of likely continued volatility in oil prices (and hence higher petrol and diesel prices), and rising house prices. Household budgets are likely to be stretched where there are high levels of car dependency and housing unaffordability – with little flexibility for rising costs in either or both of these. A composite car dependence and housing affordability (CDHA) index is developed, using indices of oil vulnerability related to car travel and housing affordability. Greater London is used as the case study, with 2001 and 2011 data analysed at the level of Lower Super Output Areas, and presented using Geographic Information System and R statistical software. The findings reveal that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, adding to the previous areas of social deprivation found mainly in East London. The composite CDHA index illustrates where the most vulnerable areas are spatially. Many neighbourhoods may become less attractive for those on median or even relatively high incomes. The areas most affected may become much more expensive to live in, potentially leading to much greater pressure on travel and housing costs as people could be forced to live further from the centre of London, including beyond the Greater London boundary, which has further implications for travel. Failing to consider these emerging affordability issues represents an oversight in terms of transport planning in London.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,British Council ,,,Discovery,

In response to an intensifying housing crisis and austerity-imposed fiscal constraints, municipalities in London are devising entrepreneurial solutions to deliver more housing. Among these ‘solutions’ can be found the early signs of the state-executed financialization of public housing in the UK with the use of speculative council-owned special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that replace existing public housing stock with mixed-tenure developments, creating ambiguous public/private tenancies that function as homes and the basis for liquid financial assets. Drawing together parallel literatures on the financialization of urban governance and housing, and combining these with original empirical research, we situate these developments in contrast to earlier modes of governance, identifying a distinct mode of entrepreneurial governance in London: financialized municipal entrepreneurialism. The local state is no longer merely the enabler—limited to providing strategic oversight of the private sector—but financializes its practice in a reimagined commercialized interventionism, as property speculator. This article concludes that while the architects of this new mode of entrepreneurialism extol the increased capacity and control it provides, any such gains must be set against longer-term financial, democratic and political risks.",Save Cressingham Gardens’ campaign ,"Cressington Gardens (51.447257523309666, -0.11189843072524697)",Research participation,,,Public Engagement ,Co-authorship with other partner(s),,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

The thesis looks at how mutual housing groups have overcome problem of collective action through selfgovernance by using formal and informal institutions used by mutual housing groups. The case studies used are based in London and are described by developing a typology of a range of mutual housing types from housing co-operatives, including short-life and long-life, fully mutual groups, through to co-housing and Community Land Trusts. Using Ostrom's work on governing the commons, a theoretical framework is developed to understand the governance practices within mutual housing groups. The thesis uses Ostrom’s institutional approach to understand mutual housing as a form of commons, and their governance practices as analogous to forms of commoning. The empirical chapters build on the interview material and cover the experiences of the mutual housing groups in accessing land, finance, their micro-practices of governance and other aspects of mutualism considered important in their experiences. The work offers a theoretical and empirical contribution to the field of the housing, collective action and governance institutions, as applied to mutual housing in London.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD Thesis

Far from signalling a ‘ruptural’ end of neoliberal modes of urban governance, the analysis presented here shows how local authorities in London are actively articulating with, mediating, and assembling central government’s radical programme of austerity. More than engendering a simple consolidation or intensification of ‘business as usual’ in a leaner register however, it is suggested that the current moment of austerity urbanism augurs a new operational matrix for local government with path changing consequences. Combining insights from post-foundational theory with in-depth qualitative empirical research, this thesis presents an in-depth ground-up analysis of how austerity urbanism has been ‘policed’ and ‘politicised’. It argues that a post-politicising ‘common sense’ over how austerity should be rolled-out is legible across London’s local authorities, based on logics of responsibilisation, contractualisation and entrepreneurialism. On the one hand, local authorities are managing demand for and divesting of services by responsibilising staff, community groups, and residents under the auspices of participatory governance whilst extending and deepening contractual arrangements with non-governmental and private providers. On the other hand, under pressure to generate new forms of revenue, local authorities are forming new real-estate special purpose vehicles to create and capture urban land and property value as rents. Whilst seeming to reproduce a condition of ‘post-political’ closure, as austerity deepens and contradictions sharpen these modes of local governance face mounting dissent from a growing part with no part. In this context, the political horizon of local government is an ambivalent one. At a moment of closure, austerity urbanism is producing opportunities for radical democratic openings even if they do not yet suggest a tipping point that could change how and for whom local government works.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD Thesis

London has more railway termini than any other world city, with apparent economic, social and spatial differences between places located in front of them and those behind. Contemporary research focuses on transport functions, on the economic potential of station buildings and on the potential for rail to increase catalyse redevelopment, while ignoring their role as the largest buildings in the city, creating separation within the street network. This thesis analyses eight main London railway termini in two time periods: the 1880s and the 2010s. These stations are served by different infrastructure types, from cuttings to viaducts, which form movement barriers in areas located behind them, which are also associated with social decline and post-industrial redevelopment. Space syntax analysis uncovers the impacts of railway termini and their associated structures on movement networks. The economic and social character of areas around the stations is then analysed, to identify differences between neighbourhoods in front of and behind stations. Historical data is mapped and compared with contemporary data, including land uses for both periods and social data from the Booth Poverty Survey, which is compared to contemporary income estimates. Analysis of spatial, social and economic character shows how the railway has influenced neighbourhoods located behind termini over a long period of time. The nature of this influence depends on infrastructure type, viaducts being associated with less separation than other railway structures. This research is significant for the long-term redevelopment of railway termini, demonstrating their importance as an integral part of the city and the significance of understanding the separation they create.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD Thesis

Three intentionalities of knowledge capture, public duty, and extra-local salience are unpacked to demonstrate the range of ways in which the bureaucratically-initiated LLA banner has been used by various development actors and organisations to validate their existing practices. The case study of the LLA as an institutionalised governance apparatus is used to analyse the impact of specific forms of social relations on the ways in which ‘models’ are produced, what their content consists of, how dominant agendas and narratives co-evolve with the priorities of an assemblage of actors, and the processes of selective abstraction used to curate particular messages and forms of fixed and potentially mobile knowledge, yet dubious claims of ‘learning’.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

Ashley Dhanani",,,Bartlett School of Architecture,"Previous research has shown that the local town centre can be a space of considerable socio-economic diversity, manifested in its being a place of work and community activity in addition to retail activity. The long-term sustainability of the town centre has been shown to correspond to its configurational spatial signatures. Where high streets exhibit a high ethnic diversity amongst proprietors, there appears to be a corresponding diversity of land use and goods, with a tendency to adapt and alter space for greater economic benefit. Small independent units are often further subdivided to accommodate a greater number of services and products. In the context of the local high street in the UK, the small independent Minority Ethnic Business (MEB) is a common feature, whether it is a halal butcher, an Indian chemist or a Chinese takeaway, serving both an embedded local minority community as well as often having a wider mainstream appeal. This paper seeks to examine the relationship between spatial configuration and socio-economic diversity of the local high street to investigate whether the potential for diversity is embedded in its contextual spatial characteristics. For the purpose of this study using nationally defined town centre boundaries, ten town centre case studies were selected from around London based on their residential ethnic profile and the level of deprivation of the area. Building on the literature that shows that land use diversity is associated with the persistence of smaller town centres, we test the proposition that it is also associated with the presence of MEBs. Here we tested the degree of impact of MEB presence on commercial diversity across these case studies. Additionally, the study examines the spatial and morphological signatures of these case studies and how these relate to the context of MEB presence and land use diversity, finding a strong relationship between spatial and urban form factors and a greater presence of MEBs. The study concludes that given the importance of spatial accessibility coupled with built form diversity to the presence of MEBs, greater attention needs to be given to the embedded social value in the spatial characteristics of town centres.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

Important sites in the city include the highly contested ‘Undercroft’ area of the Southbank, early purpose-built skateparks such as ‘Skate City’, ‘Rolling Thunder’, ‘Maddog Bowl’ and ‘Rom’, public spaces such as Kensington Gardens and Crystal Palace, and appropriated street sites in locations as diverse as the Shell Centre, Bishopsgate and St Paul’s. This chapter charts the documentation of skateboarding in the UK capital as caught on film, showing how these sites made up a vibrant skateboarding scene. In doing so, it also charts the dramatically changing technologies by which these film documentations occurred, from the earliest days of amateur movies and sporadic news coverage (capturing the relatively innocent arrival of skateboarding as a youthful pastime), through camcorder footage of the burgeoning street-skateboarding scene of the 1990s (raising issues of subculture, urban space and masculinity) through to today’s scene, where a plethora of art-based films, documentaries, social media clips and guerrilla-style advertising have become an integral part of a rich and pluralistic skateboard scene. Film is thus shown to not only help record different space and sites, but also to express and give voice to a changing set of social meanings over the last 40 years.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

This approach, however, captures only the social aspect of community, without addressing the symbolic dimension of political discourses and their national and local effects. Using data from Newham, London, this article argues that a narrow focus on social capital obfuscates the complexity of community dynamics, leading to misconceptions about the causes of social fragmentation.

However, the spatial configurations which could stimulate the transformation around the neighbourhoods of the station have not been clearly identified. It could be argued that the implementation of transport systems and the creation of new stations would enhance the mobility of the transport network and the accessibility around the station’s vicinity. Furthermore, the dynamics of pedestrian flow, generated by the new transport system might transform the social, cultural and economic activities around the stations. Therefore, the aims of this study are to analyse how the spatial configuration and the urban formation are affected by the implementation of stations and understand how the new stations emerge in the urban form. The Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) in East London, which started to operate in 2000, plays an essential role in connecting Central London with the recently developed financial district in the east. This study focuses on two stations located along the JLE, Bermondsey and West Ham, which have different topological and demographic characteristics. To determine whether the stations integrate cohesively with the urban environment, this study applies Space Syntax methods of spatial network analysis to evaluate the spatial characteristics and compares with GIS data of the house prices and land use distribution before and after the JLE. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between pedestrian movement and the distribution of residential and commercial activities within the street network structure.

The surviving building bears little resemblance to the plain, practical hospital built in open fields south of Whitechapel Road between 1752 and 1778. Its Georgian core has been concealed by numerous extensions; by the 1940s the hospital was effectively a sprawling ‘small town’. Little is known about its architect, Boulton Mainwaring, whose modest career caused George III to remark that he was merely ‘some tradesman’, and has fostered doubt that he could have been sole designer of the hospital. Research carried out for the Survey of London has clarified that Mainwaring played a pivotal role in securing a site and designing a new building, yet has also revealed that the London Hospital’s architectural history was shaped by a network of collaboration. The collaborative energy behind the scenes of great building projects is rarely glimpsed in surviving records, and much less written about as a topic of interest. This account of the early history of the London Hospital analyses its first ambitious building project and recognises the multiple voices which guided it to completion, from the charity’s surveyor, medical minds and governors to a charismatic bishop memorialised as an ‘Institutor of Infirmaries’.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.","J.

This phenomenon is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI), and this paper introduces a methodology to investigate the spatial variability of air and surface temperatures across London. In particular, this study aims to investigate if a widely used spatial resolution (1 km) is appropriate for heat-related health risk studies. Data from vehicle-transect and ASTER thermal images were overlaid on a reference grid of 1 km, used by UHI simulation models. The results showed higher variability of air temperature within some specific modelled grid cells in the city centre, while surface temperatures presented higher variability in the London borders. This investigation suggests that LST has larger variation levels and more grid cells with sub-grid variation above 1°C compared to air temperature measurements.",1.

The literature has framed this feature of the London property market as the revival of the estate model of development. That is, on the one hand, it is argued that the well-known London’s Old estates are evolving from handsoff family businesses into professionally actively managed portfolios. On the other hand, it is argued that there are emerging clusters of ownership similarly actively managed. However, little is known yet about why property owners choose to cluster their portfolios, challenging risk diversification theories, what their active management comprises and in what institutional context they operate. Using an institutional account, this research examines clusters of ownership exploring their investment and management strategies and how the institutional environment affects these strategies. Methodologically, this research follows a multiple case study design and combines quantitative and qualitative methods, with predominantly qualitative methods. Quantitative data sources include the annual reports of property companies, which were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative methods include semi-structured interviews with cluster owners and other stakeholders, which were analysed using content analysis. Research findings suggest that property owners derive a threefold advantage from clustering and actively managing their property portfolio. First, they gain an edge over the market including new acquisitions by their detailed local knowledge and concentrated ownerships. Second, they deploy an instrumentalised form of place-making in their neighbourhood by curating the mix of uses and tenant mix, their placement, and the space in-between the buildings. Third, they can occupy some of the empty governance space left by a budget-strapped planning system. These private interest-led forceful practices, coupled with a receding planning system, present new challenges to urban governance power dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

The theoretical research consisted of a review of the academic literature on public space and traditional markets using a multi-dimensional, and inter-disciplinary approach, and the empirical research involved both a typological analysis of the traditional markets in inner London’s 13 boroughs, and then an in-depth case study investigation of two of these inner London markets. This was undertaken to answer the research question of how to ensure the economic viability and social vitality of inner London's traditional markets, and respond to the challenges, tensions and opportunities presented in these complex inner city environments. London's markets need to adapt to survive because urban public spaces are continually evolving. The typological analysis of inner London's traditional markets and the case studies of the declining Petticoat Lane street market and the thriving Borough Market highlight the role of management in maintaining the markets as viable economic and social public spaces for all. Along with a strategic plan based on a vision emphasising the social and economic value of markets to their local communities, a partnership approach is key for effective and responsive micro-management. A balance between economic viability and social vitality for public spaces serving the socio-economically diverse local communities in inner London can be achieved through managing on-going tensions over time.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,PhD Thesis

This paper presents a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis of energy conservation measures for a planned large, medium-rise office building in central London, UK with Gross Floor Area of 15,590 m2 and a 60-year building lifetime. The original design complied with the UK Building Regulations Part L, achieving 40% operational carbon emission savings compared to Target Emissions Rate. The LCA solutions focused on structure, envelope, and operational systems. Embodied energy saving strategies encompassed the application of lean design principles and integration of low carbon materials. Operational energy saving techniques included the adoption of a fabric-first approach, adaptive thermal conditions and sustainable building systems. Cumulatively, these optimization strategies achieved a maximum of 16% and 13% savings on life cycle carbon and energy, respectively, compared to the original design. Embodied strategies saved 32% and 9% on embodied carbon and energy, respectively, while operational strategies reduced the original consumption by 14% on both indicators. Over a 60-year building lifetime, operational energy was 10 times higher than embodied energy, while operational carbon was 8 times higher than embodied carbon. The study findings have highlighted the significance of LCA for early stage building design decisions.","Meike Borchers

School of Architecture and Allied Arts, University of Oregon. Portland, U.S.",Bartlett School of Architecture,"Small businesses in the same sector tend to be geographically concentrated. Understanding why businesses in some industries cluster is a key issue in urban economic theory, particularly in the Marshallian and Jacobsian traditions. These emphasize the logistical and informational synergies (advantages) that accrue to firms in agglomeration economies, allowing firms located near one another to accelerate their rate of innovation. However, little is known about how spatial forms foster the clustering of firms or the mechanisms through which this process might facilitate knowledge spillover over between different businesses. In this paper we present an historical case study in which space syntax methods, archival research and urban economic theory were used to enhance understanding of the spatial ordering of London's nineteenth-and early twentieth-century furniture industry, a sector characterised by a proliferation of small, local firms. The spatial morphologies of the furniture industry in the Shoreditch and Fitzrovia areas of London are profiled by linking business directories, historical Ordnance Survey maps and Goad fire insurance plans to space syntax measures describing the spatial configuration of London's street network, on a GIS platform. Historically, the two casestudy areas have hosted a wide range of furniture-manufacturing businesses. We hypothesise that the contrast between the spatial structures of the two districts contributed to the divergent paths development of the furniture industry in these places. Our results suggest the two areas developed as different knowledge economies, in part as a consequence of their contrasting spatial configurations and their influence on industrial organization. Shoreditch became a 'specialization' economy (i.e. Marshallian). Here the organic pattern of streets allowed specialized businesses to be located in close proximity to key streets, benefiting from more local footfall, and in close localization of firms belonging to the same industry. Fitzrovia, however, showed a more 'diversified' economy (i.e. Jacobsian), accommodating most of its retailers on streets highly integrated across scales and more commercially-driven. In the context of constraints of land use and rising land values, manufacturing operations moved to other places whilst retaining large-size firms that created a retail destination in a high footfall location good for attracting passing trade. We anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the distinctive spatial cultures of urban manufacturing and to the development of a methodological approach that opens up new prospects for inter-disciplinary research.",Laura Narvaez Zertuche,"Urban Design Group, Foster + Partners Ltd.

Michael Edwards",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"The economy of London is often characterised as global, productive and competitive on a world stage, the engine of the nation. It is also experienced daily by workers and other citizens driving vehicles, serving in shops, caring for each other, cleaning, starting businesses and struggling to succeed or even survive. The city’s economy generates immense wealth but also alarming levels of in-work poverty. Official accounts of the economy tend to emphasise high-productivity sectors, increasingly concentrated in office blocks in the centre, while half the activity is distributed through the city and made up of small enterprises and interlocking sub-contractors. The pressure on these activities is increasingly intense because of the inflated prices which land commands if shifted into use for housing development. Thus there has been a great deal of displacement in recent decades and there is growing controversy about how much workspace London can afford to lose. Furthermore the economy faces two major uncertainties in the next few years: the revision of business rates which threatens many enterprises and the consequences of Brexit, via changes in the terms of trade, inflation and curbs on labour mobility. Researchers at UCL’s Bartlett School have just published the report on a small research project evaluating the various ways in which the diverse economies of London are understood, studied and planned for. Principal findings of the research are that Top-down studies of the London economy fail to connect with the growing number of Borough-level and bottom-up studies of economic activity in localities. This seriously weakens policy-making. Community groups and local business networks often have a strong understanding of the inter-connections between activities but these tend not to be assimilated into policy studies. Some standardisation of methodologies used in local studies would help to build a strategic picture and would generate the kind of local audits which need to preceed and inform policy decisions. Statisticians, planners and economists need to give more thought to some of the key concepts and categories which are used or needed in the analysis and understanding of local economies at various scales. There is great potential for productive discussion among statisticians, planners and economists at the various levels of government, resident and business communities in localities, and researchers. A shared repository of studies is needed so that best practice can more easily be shared and to avoid each study reinventing the wheel. Longitudinal studies of workers, firms and localities are never done but are essential if policy is to be adequately grounded in an understanding of how the city’s economies interact and how planning can optimise conditions for all concerned. The report is by Dr Jessica Ferm, Dr Ed Jones and Prof Michael Edwards who have collaborated with the Just Space network of community organisations.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

Images and texts were produced and consumed with an urge and at a speed never seen before. The building, through the illustrated press, left the static confines of the book and the framed print and became peopled by the purposeful bourgeoisie. Through a close analysis of a range of articles on the new Royal Exchange, the refurbished London Colosseum as well as the Queen’s Scotland tour, this essay explores the role of the architectural image in the illustrated press by focusing on its relationship to the accompanying text. Untangling the mechanics of representation and perception, it identifies modes of intellectual, affective, and kinetic vision through which architecture was represented to the remote reading public.

A transition to more environmentally sustainable travel has proved difficult to achieve, particularly in suburban areas. For individuals in society there are many different aspirations for, and constraints on, travelling in an environmentally sustainable manner. Lack of modal choice, route options, the cost of using public transport, and wider cultural norms are a few of the barriers to realizing a more sustainable transport network. Compounding this is the 'last mile' problem, concerning the facilities linking the main mode to the home, workplace or wider destination, which are often poor.

For comparison and to estimate exposure misclassification we compared Londoners LHEM exposure with exposure at the residential address, a commonly used exposure metric in epidemiological research. In 2011, the mean annual LHEM exposure to outdoor sources was estimated to be 37% lower for PM2.5 and 63% lower for NO2 than at the residential address. These decreased estimates reflect the effects of reduced exposure indoors, the amount of time spent indoors (∼95%), and the mode and duration of travel in London. We find that an individual’s exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 outside their residential address is highly correlated (Pearson’s R of 0.9). In contrast, LHEM exposure estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 suggest that the degree of correlation is influenced by their exposure in different transport modes.

It examines London, where the difference between the value of land for residential and industrial use, and the pressure to address the housing crisis, is leading to the rapid loss of industrial land and premises. The paper first explores the role of industry in a high-value city such as London, arguing that trends in manufacturing in advanced economies are increasing the benefit for firms of an urban location, whilst at the same time, cities continue to need industry if they are to be economically and socially resilient, sustainable and vibrant. The paper then explores current approaches to planning for industry in London, identifying impacts of a policy framework that anticipates and plans for its decline. Finally, it focuses on the question of how to plan for a productive and inclusive city: we explore the arguments in favour of integrating industry into the urban fabric as well as the benefits of separating land uses and retaining employment land designations, and reveal how urbanists are divided. We argue that if London is to continue to prosper, and meet the needs of all Londoners, then we need to strategically and proactively plan for industry in the city, to experiment with innovative ways of integrating it with other city uses, whilst protecting land for industry, where required. We put forward a critical research agenda to effectively meet this challenge in the future.",,,,"Think Tank

The aim of this study is to develop a methodology that allows quantification of the potential economic benefit of reducing indoor exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in children attending primary schools. Using environmental and health data collected in primary schools in London, this study estimates that, on average, 82 asthma exacerbations per school can be averted each year by reducing outdoor NO2 concentrations. The study expands upon previous analyses in two ways: first it assesses the health benefits of reducing children’s exposure to indoor NO2 while at school, second it considers the children’s perspective in the economic evaluation. Using a willingness to pay approach, the study quantifies that the monetary benefits of reducing children’s indoor NO2 exposure while at school would range between £2.5 k per school if a child’s perspective based on child’s budget is adopted up to £60 k if a parent’s perspective is considered.

It is offered with a view to help better identify the distribution of the projects costs and benefits and shed greater light on the possible ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ over space and time, and under given scenarios. Drawing from an extensive array of public domain literature the paper sets out both the policy and planning contexts for the project plus the business case that led to a decision by UK Treasury to guarantee a £1 billion loan to Transport for London for the construction of the Northern Line's extension. The paper looks at the scale and nature of the megaproject's features, particularly its line-haul and related real estate developments, especially those in the assigned development opportunity area. The text presents the policy, planning, legislative and regulative dimensions of the project likely to define its revenue generation prospects and environmental and social impacts, with special attention paid to those project outcomes affecting key stakeholders over time and space. The paper also seeks to explain the mechanics of how to employ a policy-led multi-criteria framework together with its associated processes within which stakeholder policies and agendas can be mapped and common/divergent interests identified. This is done with a view to ultimately facilitate stakeholder negotiation decision-making trade-offs in given scenarios under the policy guidance of the Greater London Authority with the support of the Treasury of the UK Government.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

To ‘make public’ expresses a demand and an aspiration; materially – to protect and extend public housing provision at a time when austerity measures are dismantling it in ideal and form [Phillips and Erdemci, 2012]; procedurally – to make visible problematic processes of urban change that are increasingly hidden from public view under the pervasive metaphor of regeneration [Campkin, 2013]; and methodologically – to make public the act of research through long-term collaborations with residents and other practitioners, using archival research and socially-engaged performance practice that reveals spatial changes and their affects on social relations [Harvie, 2013]. The thesis draws on the idea of ‘multiple publics’ to re-conceptualise a constructive approach to public housing and to evaluate the ethic of ‘making public’ [Fraser, 1990]. It works between architecture and performance to forge new connections with the research of Forty, Rendell, Schneider and Roms, and choreograph relationships between buildings, texts and residents through critical acts of writing, dramaturgy and re-enactment. The practice is conducted through performative workshops that open a social, discursive and imaginative space for residents to re-enact the histories of each estate and build collective knowledge and experience. This collaborative work is shared with wider publics through a feature-length artist’s film, site-specific performance, and six-week exhibition, and is documented in the thesis as two acts, comprising scenes interspersed with reflective essays. The evidence gathered is fed into formal and legislative frameworks with the aim of influencing housing policy: at Samuel House, a redesigned housing survey and at Balfron Tower, a listing upgrade nomination and online archive.",, , ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

The indicator Cost per Ton carbon Saved (CTS) was used, which resulted in higher values for the EnerPHit retrofit model, rendering it a less viable alternative. It was also concluded that retrofitting, in general and especially the application of EnerPHit, is an appealing option only with rising gas prices, low discount rates and long lifespans. Those results were even more amplified when climate change was taken into account, a conclusion very important for the application of future legislation and the possible transfer of this study to other climates. It was deduced that a house’s remaining lifetime is a very significant factor to be taken into account, as investments of higher capital cost give higher benefit in long term.",Sarah Harrison,,Research support ,, ,Research Support ,,,,Sustainability ,, ,,Discovery,

We examine the drivers for changing policy including the national and regional policy contexts, housing targets, the influence of austerity measures, rise of Neighbourhood Planning and changing conceptions of regeneration and the role of housing therein. The article highlights the complex task faced by local planners and the tensions involved in simultaneously finding sites for housing, fostering economic development and promoting mixed-use redevelopment in planning policy and decisions. We find that changes in policy are fuelling speculation for housing development on sites occupied by viable businesses, supporting rather than responding to deindustrialization. This is leading to a gap between aspirations for delivering mixed-use environments on hitherto employment sites and realities on the ground.",, , ,"Think Tank, Other",Aggregator,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

This paper focuses on London’s extreme experience of the housing crisis gripping the UK —itself the European nation with the fastest long-term growth of average house prices and widest regional disparities, driven by overblown financialisation and the priviledging of rent as a means of wealth accumulation, often by disposession. Londoners’ experience stems partly from four decades of neo-liberal transformation, partly from acellerated financialisation in the last 2 decades and is now being acellerated by the imposition of ‘austerity’ on low- and middle-income people. The social relationships of tenancy in social housing, private tenancy and mortgage-financed owner-occupation are, however, divisve and the paper ends by identifying what may be the beginning of a unified social movement, or at least a coalition, for change.",, , ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,Office Government Scientist,,,Discovery,

It seeks to identify the spatial conditions that, at multiple scales, mediate and support the operation of digital industries in inner-city locations. Drawing on ‘productionist’ approaches, which examine creative industries as an industry, work is conceptualized as six activities (producing, meeting, networking, learning, displaying, socializing) performed across four spatial settings: the extended workplace, workspaces, industry events, and the neighbourhood. This qualitative case study uses three data collection methods: semi-structured interviews with workers and industry actors, observations of selected settings, and secondary data. The area is an emergent cluster of digital firms known as ‘Silicon Roundabout’ and ‘Tech City’, providing a less explored but relevant case. The thesis’ contribution is threefold. First, it provides an empirical account of the spatiality of digital work in Shoreditch. This reveals a network of spaces used for work (base, ancillary, and events) suggesting a reconfiguration, and extension, of the ‘workplace’ in these industries. This spatial extension is limited and associated with spatial requirements of the tasks involved; the office still plays a central role in digital production. Second, the study identifies macro and micro spatial conditions that mediate and support these work patterns across the four spatial settings and advances the conceptualization of functional, social, and symbolic aspects of these relationships, expanding the understanding of why and how place matters in the digital economy. Third, the analysis reveals that ‘structured interaction’ and micro processes of spatial segregation and exclusion are critical to support a range of work and social practices in digital production. In contrast to influential accounts that associate creative cities with diversity and tolerance, at the scale of these spatial practices, processes of selection and quest for sameness underpin the operation of these industries within urban space(s).",, , ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

The digitalisation and deregulation of the industry since the 1950s has been at the heart of this fear, giving rise to a situation whereby the more complex and rapid financial transactions become, the less visible and less easily regulated they are. Consequently the global economy is often perceived to be a black box within which immaterial capital-flows circulate, unencumbered by the inconveniences of geography or the built environment. Yet the reality of this system is far from friction free. The world of financial services is orchestrated around people and places, co-ordinated through infrastructure and architecture, and accommodated in offices and cities. While the financial transaction itself may be an immaterial act, it relies upon a set of specific material conditions to take place. This thesis is an exploration of those conditions. Through an analysis of the urban and architectural development of the City of London, London’s financial district, in the post-war period, the research considers the extent to which there is a relationship between the structure of the financial system and the structure of the environment in which it operates. This thesis is the first comprehensive material investigation of a financial centre to date. Furthermore, it is the first study that can claim to have looked at the recent architectural history of the City of London in any depth. Buttressed by two episodes of destructive violence – World War II and the IRA bombings of the early 90s – which would each herald a new urban paradigm, the research charts the gradual deregulation of the UK finance industry and its manifestation in the built form, socio-spatial arrangement, and cultural milieu of the financial centre. Structured in the shape of a conceptual cross-section, the thesis is organised into four chapters that move from the urban scale of the City, through its streets, across its facades and into the micro-geography of its interiors, in the form of trading floors, offices and furniture. The aim is not to provide a descriptive inventory of buildings and streets, but rather to connect each material layer to the wider economic and regulatory developments in the global economy, thereby creating a constant dialogue between financial place and financial space.",, , ,, ,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.","Transport for London

In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture. We identify such interventions for each segment and region and conclude that comparative assessment of attitudinal, alongside geographical, characteristics of metropolitan travellers can provide better strategic input for realistic scenario-building and ex-ante assessment of sustainable transport policy.","1.

This research argues similarities within submarkets are not only captured by its building and location characteristics but also in how each dwelling is inter-connected within its local area and embedded to the rest of the system. This research conjectures that spatial network local-areas as defined by community detection methods can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets. In order to test this conjecture, the hedonic approach will be used as an empirical strategy on the case study of London. The study found spatial network local areas correspond with planned known local area boundaries and that greater house price similarity is found within spatial network local-areas than between. The study also found that spatial network local area as defined by community detection technique can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets to explain house price. The contribution of this research is it represents a proof of concept in the use of community detection techniques in the definition of spatial housing submarket. Importantly it illustrates the significance in how spatial configuration influences housing market not just in terms of accessibility (Law et al. 2013) but also in terms of housing submarket. Further research will be carried out to study the spatial configuration of the spatial network local areas in understanding severances and connectivity between them.

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is such a concept. The objective of the FS-MaaS project is to propose the design of a MaaS concept for London, the MaaS-London, and examine its feasibility. To work towards the concept of MaaS-London, first, the supply and the demand sides of the London transport market are analysed. There are a variety of mobility services supplied in London such as car clubs (car sharing), ride sharing, bike sharing, public transport, rail and taxi which altogether make London an ideal ground to exploit MaaS-London. The MaaS-London is an integrated platform that includes registration and package selection, intermodal journey planning, booking, smart ticketing and payment functions so that the entire chain of transport can be managed in this centralised platform. The most outstanding feature of MaaS-London is the provision of mobility packages, which consist of tailored bundles of mobility services customised to individual needs. The feasibility study indicates that the introduction of MaaS-London will benefit both the supply and the demand side. Transport operators will benefit by creating a larger market via the integrated platform. Travellers will also welcome the concept due to travel expense and time reduction, and better service experience. MaaS-London is a feasible product that can well serve London transport market and contribute to London’s 2020 vision.",, , ,,,,,,,Technology and Computation ,,,,Discovery,

The core inquiry applies a configurational analysis to the street, viewing it as a complex entity which interfaces with both buildings and the urban street network. The research is founded on the identification of two theoretical and methodological gaps in the canon of urban design: how generic building morphology properties relate to street liveability; and, how urban diversity emerges as the result of diachronic processes. The thesis looks at architecture beyond function, geometry and aesthetics, focusing on the urban street as a generator for social contact. Building on space syntax theory, it seeks to advance the concept of the ‘virtual community’, proposing that encounter and co-presence patterns are the product of both city-wide connections and local building morphology. In order to study building-street relations in terms of the virtual community the thesis has developed a series of specialised techniques to describe and analyse the synchronic and diachronic aspects of space. The thesis is innovative in integrating space syntax and Conzenian methods to better examine the micromorphology of the street interface configurationally and typologically, capturing the changing nature of built form and building use over time. This methodology is applied to the study of two contrasting urban areas: Islington, London and West Village, Manhattan. Both possess similar building morphologies that have sustained street liveability and diversity over centuries. The results show how urban change and diversity are affected by diachronic processes working with the synchronic structure of the everyday city. The thesis asserts that urban configuration and built form together play an essential role in shaping the character of the ‘virtual community’ as well as the potential for street life itself.",,,,,,,,,,Design,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Discovery,PhD thesis

This paper travels back in time to look for the foundations of these cities’ architectural and urban morphology. The study is focused on the architecture of the everyday, the vernacular buildings which collectively form the character of a city’s historical built environment. It discusses how both preconceived frameworks and emergent architectural decisions and societal rules have shaped the two cities throughout their spatial histories. Drawing evidence from historical and empirical data the analysis presented in this paper builds on space syntax research which investigates morphological processes in urban configurations. The paper looks at two contrasting cases of urban grids to contribute to the understanding of the way different spatial arrangements influence city form. The urban past of London and Manhattan is considered in terms of planning intentions, architecture, urban form and the embodied socio-cultural models and ideals. The approach emphasises the way architectural and urban scales were configured together to produce each city’s historical morphological identity and spatial culture. This stems from an effort to form a parallel understanding of both the building unit and the urban realm where this is situated. In this perspective, the discussion provides an overview on the one hand, of the building aggregation rules of the London terraced house and the Manhattan row house schemes; and on the other hand, the structure of the urban grid in each case. The aim is to shed light on the interplay of these two elements, underlining the challenge for any urban design approach: to tackle both buildings and streets along the lines of a unifying and diachronic spatial logic. The study considers the syntactical and morphological properties of urban space, looking at the building, the block and the city scales. The paper aims to highlight that both for London and Manhattan there exist inherent cross-scale organisational consistencies that hold the spatial cultures of each city together.",, , ,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Discovery,

Supervised and operated via its members, the components of each institution were tied together through a mode of exchange that prized face-to-face contact, reputation and trust, epitomised by the Stock Exchange motto Dictum Meum Pactum (‘My word is my bond’). The latter was made concrete via messenger-operated payment and clearing systems, organised around the hours of trade, provoking the need for proximity between institutions and specific architectural arrangements and resulting in an urban agglomeration of banks and other institutions in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England. The advent of digital technology entailed a decline in the economic significance of pedestrian activity in the City. The shift from manual, paper operations to onscreen transactions made redundant the kinetic network of brokers and messengers that once formed the circulatory system for banking and finance. This paper considers the way in which such shifts ultimately reconfigured the nature of the street as public space and argues that, as fundamental parts of the financial transaction were removed from the City’s thoroughfares, the street would no longer be an extension of the workplace, but a space of leisure. Exploring concepts such as ‘transaction’, ‘regulation’ and ‘exchange’ as social processes with material consequences, this paper attempts to chart the historical link between the street and economic activity, through analysis of the City’s myriad pedestrian ways and changing attitudes to planning public space in the fifty years following the Second World War.",, , ,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,, ,,Discovery,

In recent years, the focus of economic development initiatives has shifted away from supply side initiatives, such as fiscal incentives and the direct provision of premises, towards a consideration of the collective provision of infrastructure and services, in order to meet demands of businesses and workers in cities where there is already strong demand and growth. As well as this shift from supply- to demand-side initiatives, there has been a change in the political ideological approach to land and property development, away from public sector direct provision and funding, to place greater onus on the private sector to deliver development, infrastructure and services. The introduction of ‘affordable workspace’ planning policies by local authorities in London from the early 2000s is part of this shift – building on more established key worker and affordable housing policies. This paper evaluates the success of affordable workspace planning policies in thirteen mixed use schemes in London, from the perspectives of developers and workspace providers, who are responsible for delivering and managing the affordable workspace. First, it finds that the perspective of the developer, in particular whether it sees affordable workspace policy as (a) an opportunity, (b) a ‘tool’ to secure planning permission or (c) a burden, is mostly influenced by the way in which the affordable workspace emerged within the proposal. Developers’ perspectives and the success of their partnerships with workspace providers are critical to the successful delivery of affordable workspace within the scheme. Second, the findings show that ‘affordable workspace’ is difficult to define and deliver, with different interpretations used by delivery partners and the ability of workspace providers to deliver affordability depends critically on their organisational model. Finally, the research shows that although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, it is not benefiting low-value manufacturers or small family-run retail and service businesses, nor is it generally benefiting start-ups. The implications of policy outcomes for economic development are considered; overall the beneficial impacts are limited. The research concludes that the predominant model of affordable workspace policy being promoted in London will fail to meet the aspirations of policy makers, with the limited success of policy further compounded by the global recession of the late-2000s.

Adopting the hegemonic political and economic theories of Neoliberalism on the general and macro level, and the more specific theories of place marketing on the micro level, this research argues that place marketing is one of the neoliberal imaginaries used to legitimate neoliberal practices, such as Olympic land acquisition. The author connects the abstract theories of Neoliberalism and the concrete theories of place marketing with Sklair’s Transnational Capitalist Class (2001) theory which suggests the formation of globally mobile elites who with their highly mobile capital have become very influential in the staging of urban mega-events and mega projects. In the particular case of the Olympic Games, some of these mobile capitalists have been very active in providing official sponsorship in exchange of exclusive marketing rights to associate their brands with the Olympics. Based on reviews of major Olympic-related official documents, a news survey on national, city and local newspapers and 31 elite interviews covering official place marketers of London, local governments, regional governmental bodies, Olympic Delivery Authority, official Olympic sponsors, small business owners and NGOs, this study points out the conflict of interests between place marketers and product marketers at the junction of urban mega-events. Understanding London’s top world city status and taking into account the desire to host the Olympic Games for a third time in response to fierce inter-city competition, this research indicates how place marketing is in theory a development strategy but in practice a difficult task due to the financial dilemmas and legal issues faced by neoliberalised governments. Legislations passed and contracts signed specifically for the Olympic Games have provided priorities and exclusive rights to official sponsors who are the product marketers in this case over place marketers. This thesis explores the complex legal issues surrounding Olympic place marketing which has a distinct but limited literature, and how localities on different geographical levels are affected by such legal arrangements.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

However, decision-making involves the everyday life of using and navigating in the built environment to the management of urban space. This paper seeks to understand the basic notion of how pedestrian movement is related to land use choices in the built form. The hypothesis is that movement itself involves a choice; that is, a decision-making of direction and destination, of passing through or of static behaviour. The density of movement flow is seen as a result of locations that potentially become attractors that have a rich distribution of land use. How we accommodate and modulate movement is thus important in helping us understand the multiple effects of everyday use that arises from decision-making processes and its subsequent effectuation in the configuration of urban space. Therefore, two key questions are addressed: first, how the types of movement choices influence and are influenced by the spatial layout; and second, how the distribution of land uses is affected by such choices. The paper uses Space Syntax and Game theory as a combination of theoretical frameworks that study independent and interdependent decision-making processes in urban space, to answer these questions. Taking the River Thames Path as an example, the research project focuses on the unconnected section of the river walk between London Bridge and Southwark Bridge. In analogy with a game of chess, the results demonstrate how different kinds of choices are ruled primarily by the location of commercial uses in the urban grid.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,

It examines the steps taken to protect the capital’s architecture during these early attacks, which devastated a large area of the historic City of London and destroyed many of its most important monuments, including several of Sir Christopher Wren’s churches. St Paul’s Cathedral’s survived amidst the ruins, adding to the power of its symbolism. This paper also looks briefly at how the experience of the Blitz stimulated the conservation and building-recording movement in Britain, and at plans by some leading thinkers to leave ruined City churches as war memorials after the conflict.",,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,Discovery,No access to this article

Places such as London, with one of the oldest flushing toilet and sewer systems in the world, bears witness to the limits of its universal applicability through dwindling freshwater resources and polluted waterways. It is therefore important to develop new forms of sanitation infrastructure. An actor–network theory coevolution framework is used to explore and gain insights into the coevolution pathways for new types and paradigms of sanitation in London, where waterborne sanitation is currently prevalent. This approach shows that while flushing toilets are currently stable network configurations, there are coevolution pathways that would shift the system towards dry sanitation. The quantity of freshwater resources available for toilet flushing was the main actant cited for the development of these coevolution pathways.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,,,,Discovery,

The first five novels each written Le Carré and Deighton were published in the period 1960-1970. Although both authors and these specific works have remained popular in genre spy fiction, there has been little consideration of the works in relation to each other and in their role together in situating the potential threats of the post-war period in a UK domestic setting rather than on mainland Europe. The transition of Fleming’s novels into film starting with ‘Dr No’ in 1962 suggested that UK spies engaging in espionage undertook this in exotic locations which were far removed from everyday life. An examination of the fiction of Deighton and Le Carré suggests a different world where the locus of external danger was in the suburban midst of Surrey or Wood Green. Whilst the war was over, the British state was still actively defending itself from internal threats and external dangers. The use of specific London locations in these first ten novels – particularly in ‘Call for the Dead’, and ‘The Spy who came in from the Cold’ by Le Carré and ‘The Ipcress File’ and ‘Berlin Game’ by Deighton create a language of location and fear. The roles played by the leading characters in these novels are complementary - Le Carré’s desk based controllers and Deighton’s operational spies – and appeal to different audiences many of whom had experience of war or conscription. This paper will explore the role of these novels in creating a new climate of public awareness in the post-war state through their locational specificity in London.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

Pilkey,,,Bartlett School of Architecture,"This thesis offers a London-based contemporary study of sexuality at home. I draw from architectural history, feminist and queer theory as well as geographies of sexualities to interrogate the stability of domesticity. Highlighting everyday homemaking practices of more than 40 non-heterosexual households in London, I seek to complicate one overarching regime of power that dominates our cultural value system: heteronormativity – the idea that normative heterosexuality is the default sexuality to which everyone must conform or declare themselves against. The project is a response to three decades of academic research that has looked at the spatialised ways in which sexual identity unfolds in, for the most part, peripheral zones in the ‘Western’ metropolis, spaces beyond the domestic realm. This thesis takes a different architectural approach; one where through interviewing 47 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Londoners, as well as eleven domestic tradespeople that work in these homes, agency is given to small-scale domestic interventions and everyday actions. The concept of ‘queering’ is important to the framework, which, in the context of the thesis, is understood as an on-going process that LGBTQ people are engaged in through homemaking and daily living. Although some participants may not see this as a political act, I argue otherwise and suggest queering at home is a form of political activism. Through mundane domestic actions the overarching structure of heteronormativity might be challenged. I contend that queering the home unfolds in various, complex and conflicting ways. The thesis seeks to provoke both queer theory and politics, by opening up existing approaches and remits to allow room for a domestic method. In addition, the thesis seeks to challenge assumptions within architecture but also in the wider sense. I aim to break down stereotypes surrounding non-heterosexual homemaking practices that architectural studies and media representations problematically reproduce.",Local participants,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,PhD thesis

This thesis argues that the language of public participation is not used politically for describing extra-discursive realities about public participation. Instead, it is used performatively and, as such, the politics of public participation involves a struggle between actors over the institutionalisation of particular configurations of social relations around the planning process. It also argues that this struggle is strategic and directed at the achievement of certain planning outcomes, which would be more difficult if another configuration were institutionalised. Therefore, this thesis analyses the storylines of public participation as a significant category of political analysis, and investigates the strategic use of participatory storylines by the GLA planners as they struggled over competing planning agendas. This is conduced also in the context of a variety of interests of other actors that competed against that of the planners during the London Plan making process. The research contributes to an understanding of how planners conceptualise public participation in a variety of innovative ways through performative discursive actions and how they shape planning outcomes by altering existing social relations within planning processes. It also demonstrates how their discursive actions have limited influence in planning institutions with unequal authority positions and how the planning outcomes are seemingly determined by structural forces beyond their control. Social constructivist perspective that focuses on analyzing planners’ personal dynamics helps to highlight the creative ways in which planners deal with and effectively manage competing knowledge, interests and agendas on public participation. It also contributes to clarifying areas of further research in exploring the limits and possibilities that public participation offer to planners within contemporary planning practices.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

And does UPA practised by urban farmers of foreign origin contribute to the expansion of biodiversity in cities? A comparative analysis of current peri-urban agriculture practices in Lisbon and London was carried out in allotment gardens and other spaces far from the centre in and on the edges of these capital cities. In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society. In London, migrants of foreign origin become part of an integrated communitarism on an individual basis. Concerning the contribution of peri-urban agriculture to biodiversity, evidence gathered strongly suggests that urban farmers of foreign origin do contribute to broadening biodiversity primarily in Lisbon and to a lesser extent in London. Final observations note to what extent these urban practices contribute to the Right to the City and thus if they are, more broadly, of an emancipatory and transformative nature.","

Given the topicality of this issue for policy-makers it is worth enquiring into precisely how far such narratives are in fact supported by a long-term perspective on historical changes in high street land uses in relation to the evolving spatial morphology of small town centres, in order to better distinguish the extent to which a further layer of socio-cultural explanation is required to account for the concern over ‘decline’. This research, undertaken as part of the EPSRC Adaptable Suburbs project at UCL, uses fully digitized historical maps, contemporary and historical land use data and space syntax analysis to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in and around two suburban high streets of Greater London since the nineteenth century: Surbiton and South Norwood. Drawing on Hillier and colleagues’ theory of ‘movement economy, the contemporary English high street, as it is represented in the case-study areas, emerges as a distinctive and resilient spatial morphology which has supported varied modes of land use over time. It concludes that the narrative of high street decline in part reflects a dominant focus on difficulties facing the UK retail sector and that a broader focus on the high street as a (re)generative social space rather than simply as a ‘retail attractor’ would allow for a broader appreciation of both its morphological and socio-economic capacities.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),EPSRC  EP/I001212/1,,Discovery,

Sam Griffiths  ",,,Bartlett School of Architecture,"This article addresses the question of how the fringes of cities develop spatially at both the local scale of the individual town centre and in relation to the wider urban network. The changing network structure of the street systems of two outer suburban areas of Greater London, Surbiton and South Norwood, are analysed from the 1880s onwards. A temporal reading of the process of urban growth in relation to the historic street network of local centres allows for a nuanced understanding of the way in which cities grow over time. Rather than conceptualising suburban growth as either a seeding of new territories in tabula rasa or a ‘swallowing-up’ of older settlements, this article argues for a measured description of the spatial, social and economic properties of urban grid intensification. This research uses digitised historical maps, historical and contemporary land-use data together with space syntax analysis in order to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in London’s suburban street network from the 1880s. The analysis demonstrates that over the period of time considered there have been distinct stages in the spatial development of the city’s urban fringe. The results show that as London expanded to encircle new territories, the spatial relationships of fringe areas of the city changed markedly as larger scale infrastructure was built and local development intensified, with the effect of reconfiguring the local network of the case study suburbs. However, detailed analysis of the formation of suburban town centres using space syntax also uncovers distinctive and resilient spatial morphologies which have sustained varied modes of land use over time. Drawing on the theory of the urban ‘movement economy’ and our previous research in this area, the article shows how the complex balance of change and continuity realised in the spatial morphology of the suburban high street can be explained by complex scalar mechanisms of adaptability. We argue that these qualities have helped ensure the resilience of historical suburban centres even in the face of radical social change.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),EPSRC  EP/I001212/1,,Discovery,"This article is part of the Adaptable Suburbs project which also include researchers:

Floodwater may deposit harmful microorganisms on building surfaces, while damp indoor environments in flooded dwellings can support the growth of microorganisms including mould, bacteria, and protozoa. This thesis investigates possible flood-borne and damp-related pathogens in flooded London dwellings, and the potential duration of microbial contamination risk following a flood event. Microbiological laboratory work and models are used to characterise microbial risk within flooded dwellings. Dwelling archetypes representative of the London housing stock are developed and hygrothermal simulation techniques used to model the flooding and drying behaviour of the archetypes under different scenarios in order to predict the duration of damp and microbial risk inside typical dwellings. The results of the combined biological and hygrothermal models are mapped alongside existing flood risk maps in order to predict areas in London susceptible to long-term microbial risk or prolonged displacement following a flood. Highlights of the research findings include the following (i) The persistence of bacterial contaminants on flooded materials is related to the type of floodwater, the drying conditions including temperature and drying rate, and the material drying characteristics, ii) Different dwellings in London have different drying behaviours due to their built form and dominant wall types, with modern purpose-built flats the most prone to long-term damp and microbial risk following a flood event, (iii) The flood height, external weather, and internal conditions including heating and ventilation can have a major impact on the length of time a dwelling will remain at risk of microbial contamination, and (iv) The concentration of properties vulnerable to long-term microbial exposure following major flood events is highest in areas of South and East London, particularly Southwark.",,,,,,,,,,Health,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),"EPSRC: EP/G029881/1, PE/F007132/1",,Discovery,PhD thesis

Although external factors, such as urban morphology and greening, may influence the spatio-temporal variation of overheating risk, the individual building characteristics are also likely to be important. This paper presents the results of EnergyPlus dynamic thermal simulations of 3456 combinations of dwelling types and characteristics selected to represent the London domestic stock. Two Design Summer Year weather files were used to represent the current and future climate: the CIBSE 1984–2004 and a UKCP09 future weather file (50th percentile of external temperature, 2050s, medium emissions scenario). Appreciable variation between dwelling types but generally greater variation within dwelling type was found depending on such factors as orientation, surrounding buildings and insulation levels. Under the current climate, the insulation levels had considerable impact on indoor temperatures, with combined retrofitting of roof insulation and window upgrades reducing daytime living room temperatures during the warmest continuous 5-day period of modelling by, on average, 0.76 °C (%95C.I. 0.63, 0.89 °C) for mean temperature and 1.30 °C (%95C.I. 1.05, 1.54 °C) for maximum temperature. On the other hand, internally retrofitted walls and floors tended to increase daytime living room temperatures, with a combined effect of 0.46 °C (%95C.I. 0.33, 0.60 °C) increase in mean temperature and 0.71 °C (%95C.I. 0.47, 0.96) increase in maximum temperature.

Identifying the determinant factors for energy demand and thermal comfort across a city is hence a key requirement for energy efficient retrofit and public health strategies. The aim of this thesis was to assess the relative impact of urban warming, built form and fabric characteristics on domestic energy use and overheating risk across a major city, using London as a case study. Two housing stock models were developed: a heat demand model based on steady-state energy use calculation techniques and a multiple linear regression overheating risk meta-model of an existing dynamic thermal simulation program. Input data was derived from existing Geographic Information System databases, national housing surveys and local urban air temperature models. The heat demand model successfully reproduced the ranking of urban areas based on their actual gas consumption (R² = 0.817) in a case study area containing 8.6% of London's dwelling stock. The heat island was found to decrease the average annual domestic heating load by 14% in these urban areas compared to a rural reference site. It was shown that the overheating meta-model can replicate the output of the thermal simulation program (R² = 0.763). It was indicated that highly exposed dwelling types, such as top floor flats and bungalows, as well as internally insulated buildings are likely to present an indoor overheating problem during periods of hot weather. However, the agreement between modelled overheating levels and monitored data collected in 101 London homes in summer 2009 was relatively weak, thus highlighting the modifying role of occupant controlled ventilation for indoor thermal conditions.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,,,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

In particular, Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres suggests that markets have a role to play in revitalising town centres and offering retail choice. To date, very little is known about the contemporary relevance of markets and specifically why markets have been prioritised in retail planning policy and received public policy interest. This paper investigates these issues further. Through a literature review, it develops a conceptual and contextual framework for understanding markets. It then draws on empirical research, i.e. survey and interview data from a study of London boroughs and a case study of one London Local Authority (Camden), to highlight the effects of current day-to-day management and planning approaches in sustaining markets. The research demonstrates that the contemporary role of the market is multidimensional, e.g. they appear to play significant roles as managed public space but also act as an important social and economic space, particularly for marginal social groups. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that, whilst proactive planning policies do not guarantee a vibrant market, they can play a key part in protecting their permanent loss; however, equally important is the supportive management approaches taken in shaping their social survival. The research findings have relevance for the theorisation of markets in a contemporary context, as well as implications for the practical effects of planning policy intervention on markets.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

Improvements are made on existing empirical measures by providing comprehensive intra-metropolitan analysis; increasing network routing accuracy with UK public transport timetable and GPS-based average road speed data; allowing multimodal travel; and developing metrics suitable for travel sustainability analysis. The output unit of CO2 emissions has been selected to enable the integration of mode-choice and travel distance data, and to aid compatibility with integrated assessment applications. The methodology is applied to the case study of the London Region for the year 2001. A very high degree of intra-metropolitan variation is identified in the results. Employment sub-centres diverge in their per-capita CO2 emissions by up to 300%, with specific problems of carbon intensive commuting to major airports and the specialised employment region of the Western Sector. These findings indicate that subcentre travel variation may be intrinsic to polycentric urban structures. The paper discusses means to improve the methodology, in relation to issues of coefficient disaggregation and modelling more complicated multi-modal trips.","Transport for London

It attempts to correct the misunderstandings in Marxian land rent theory and develop it for an urban context. The four categories of land rent of differential rent, differential rent 2, absolute rent, and monopoly rent are critically re-examined. Subsequently, the combination of absolute rent and differential rent is suggested as a general structure for land rents in an urban context. The dynamic mechanism of changes in land rents is explained with the concepts of emulation, differentiation and shift between groups of houses based on the structure of land rents. The process of the formation of housing submarkets has been examined for a practical preparation for empirical analysis and a theoretical basis for the subdivision of the housing market. Spatial submarkets are identified by focusing on the interactive relationship between residential spheres (a unit consisting of a centre of employment and the surrounding residential area). Sectoral submarkets are defined based on social and environmental features as well as the structural features of dwellings. For empirical analysis, three metropolitan cities were chosen: London as monocentric, Seoul as tri-centric and Los Angeles as polycentric. Empirical analysis has used commuting patterns and the contours of house prices as the criteria to identify spatial submarkets with the help of network analysis and GIS. Simple OLS regression analysis of house prices on the accessibility to centre was conducted in each identified submarket. The results were used to explore the structure of and the dynamic changes in land rents. A consistent structure of land rents was observed in each housing submarket across all three cities. The implication on the condition of labour reproduction was drawn out by interpreting the changes in land rents over a period of 10 years in each city. The analysis of London revealed a monocentric housing market structure and the suitability of commuting time over physical distance as an accessibility variable. In Seoul‟s case, the transition from tri-centric to monocentric housing market was observed and a comparative approach with rent and price data enriched the interpretation of the changes in the structure of the housing market. The impact of social and environmental features of the neighbourhood, such as class, ethnic concentration and negative externality, on house prices was highlighted in the analysis of Los Angeles.",,,,,,Data support,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD thesis

It found actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways between current material configurations and social practices for these reconfigurations. Material configurations include infrastructures, urban form, fixtures, fittings, and water types. Social practices, include existing behaviours, imagined behaviours, desires, and aspirations. This is an important question to answer because there are many places around the world, both in developed and developing countries that currently face inadequate water supplies to serve the needs of their ever growing populations, or conversely flooding due to extreme precipitation or sea level rise. The lower Lea river basin in London is one such area. The large scale engineering solutions of pipes and pumps to control water that have been the typical solution are reaching their limits therefore it is imperative to find other means to manage water in urban environments. This research used an actor-network theory co-evolution framework to understand the existing urban water-cycle, and to find areas of transformation in order to develop actor-network co-evolutionary pathways for change. Interviews, group discussions and water diaries were used to investigate the existing conditions and anticipated future changes of both private citizens and water professionals. An iterative process of design synthesis and discussions were repeated twice to test and define the actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways. This research stretches actor-network theory from its ethnographic beginnings into the realm of the future through design propositions. It found that there were two strongly favoured actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways for reconfiguring the urban water-cycle in the lower Lea river basin. These were increasing freshwater productivity and transforming waste to resource. These create new water-cycle assemblages that offer advantages to people who face many, yet uncertain, types of water stress in the future.",Local participants,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD thesis

This paper presents the outcomes of a qualitative study, which used discussion groups relating to water infrastructure with environmentally aware citizens in five London boroughs in the Lower Lea River Basin. The results showed a subtle interaction between users, water and technology. Users are generally unaware of their own water consumption. Individual perceptions of changes in water behaviour are constrained by habit and lack of knowledge about what changes can be made and how. Knowledge of environmental information was described as the inspiration behind making any changes. The paper concludes that access to information about water resources, infrastructure and conservation measures should be enhanced because although information sources are abundant, participants claimed they were inaccessible without considerable effort.

In London, planning authorities are developing policies based on the affordable housing model that require developers of mixed-use schemes on land previously in employment use, to include an amount of ‘affordable workspace’. This research examines policy objectives and outcomes of thirteen mixed-use schemes with affordable workspace across London, with a particular focus on the London Borough of Hackney, which has been using planning gain to implement affordable workspace since 2003. The perspectives of the three main stakeholders are considered; the planning authority, the developer and the workspace provider. The research reveals that the motivations for affordable workspace policies are more about promoting economic development – in particular either protecting or promoting creative industry clusters – than promoting social equity or sustainability. To ascertain whether policy is addressing the problem, the case studies explore the factors influencing the success of schemes, the difficulty of defining and delivering ‘affordability’, whether the causes of the problem are being tackled, and who are the winners and losers. The impact of policy on economic development, city vibrancy, social equity and sustainability is analysed. The policy’s contribution to job creation, cluster formation and economic diversity is explored with reference to local and regional objectives. The research shows that, although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, there are problems of industrial gentrification, the plight of lower-value businesses, and homogenous developments that contribute little to the economic or social diversity of the area. Recommendations are made for alternative or complementary strategies to address the problems facing small, low-value businesses in cities.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,"PhD thesis, full text not available"

Contemporary world cities are characterised by high levels of economic specialisation between intra-urban centres, an expanding regional scope, and market-led processes of development. These issues have been given relatively little attention in sustainable travel research, yet are increasingly defining urban structures, and need to be much better understood if improvements to urban transport sustainability are to be achieved. London has been argued to be the core of a polycentric urban region, and currently there is mixed evidence on the various sustainability and efficiency merits of more decentralised urban forms. The focus of this research is to develop analytical tools to investigate the links between urban economic geography and transportation sustainability; and apply these tools to the case study of the London region. An innovative methodology for the detailed spatial analysis of urban form, employment geography and transport sustainability is developed for this research, with a series of new application of GIS and spatial data to urban studies. Firstly an intra-metropolitan scale of spatial analysis is pursued, allowing both an extensive regional scope and a sufficiently intensive local level of detail to analyse the decentralisation processes described above. Secondly a series of detailed spatial datasets are introduced to analyse employment geography and dynamics, including business survey data and fine-scale real-estate data. For the measurement of accessibility, detailed network analysis and congestion data is used. Finally for the assessment of transportation sustainability, an indicator of CO2 emissions at intra-urban scales is developed, and is calculated for the 6.5 million journey-to-work trips in the study region. The results highlight extreme intra-urban variation in accessibility, employment geography and travel carbon emissions with clear relevance to urban form and sustainable travel debates in the London region.","1.

They are more than structures contrived from planned associations amongst industry professionals. Instead, a building involves processes of engagement amongst different groups, technologies, materials and methods. It is these processes of socio-techno engagement which contribute to the uptake of the sustainability agenda, and in turn can create sustainability effects. The following research sets out problems associated with the traditional staged approach to development and conceptualisations of building sustainability as an output. It proposes instead a network approach as a conceptual framework for understanding processes of socio-techno network engagements with the sustainability agenda. To this end, three research questions are presented: one empirical, one analytical and one conceptual, each of which focuses on the application of a network approach to the study of urban development and the uptake of the sustainability agenda. The network approach adopted draws on key facets of Actor-network Theory and Social Network Analysis. A qualitative methodology is employed to investigate a case study London sustainable prime commercial building process: the PricewaterhouseCoopers new headquarters development, 7 More London. Analysis of interview data is coded and mapped using ATLAS.ti software. Empirical research focuses on identification of social and technical actors involved in building networks, and understanding the mobilisers and intents of their actions. There is also an explicit focus on boundary objects: how common objects and objectives, and translations of them, effectively facilitate and delimit engagement both in the development process and with the sustainability agenda. 5 key findings emerge from detailed analysis which collectively help answer the research questions and raises some new questions of their own.

The previous study used a hedonic modelling approach to assess how the amount of green space within wards in London affected house prices, whilst taking into consideration other influential factors such as transportation accessibility and housing density. The hedonic pricing method is based on the theory that the value of a good is based on the combination of the many attributes the good possesses. In the case of housing this includes domestic facilities, access to services and so on. The value of individual attributes can be inferred from the hedonic model, and thus it is a useful method for estimating the value of attributes that influence house prices, particularly where markets do not exist such as for green spaces.

Tower Hamlets, a borough in East London was experiencing similar trends and with the contribution of initiatives and policies from Central Government the Idea Stores concept was born. These innovative and modern new learning centos were designed to replace the old, out dated library services the borough had previously had and were built to be community focal points, providing not just books as is the traditional stereotype of libraries but offering computer and internet facilities, educational classes for all ages, cafes, creches and relaxing atmospheres for all members of society. They were built to stand out from surrounding buildings with new designs catching the eye of passers by. There are currently four Idea Stores that have been completed and running for several years with a further three to be built and open in the near future. It is the four that have been opened that this research project will investigate. It will also look at the issues facing the country's library facilities and investigate the ways the Idea Stores have sort to change the public perception of libraries as old, formal and in some cases intimidating facilities to welcoming, relaxed and enjoyable institutions. The conclusions are that overall the Idea Stores have been successful in attracting visitors to use the facilities and the take up of services such as educational classes and internet terminals has been very high. The only concerns were that the overall rebranding of the Idea Store name rather than the term library has led to confusion about what the facility is for and a cessation of advertising after the first two Idea Stores opened has also posed a problem.",visitors and managers at Idea Store,,Anonymous Public Engagement,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure.Methods: Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with high or very high exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure.Results: Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a high or very high risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between high or very high exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to no exposure likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for number of residents and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern.Conclusion: This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit. As health status was self-reported, this association requires further investigation.",,"

We redress this here by examining scaling relationships in a world city using data on the geometric properties of individual buildings. We first summarise how power laws can be used to approximate the size distributions of buildings, in analogy to city-size distributions which have been widely studied as rank-size and lognormal distributions following Zipf [Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort (Addison-Wesley, Cambridge, 1949)] and Gibrat [Les Inegalites Economiques (Librarie du Recueil Sirey, Paris, 1931)]. We then extend this analysis to allometric relationships between buildings in terms of their different geometric size properties. We present some preliminary analysis of building heights from the Emporis database which suggests very strong scaling in world cities. The data base for Greater London is then introduced from which we extract 3.6 million buildings whose scaling properties we explore. We examine key allometric relationships between these different properties illustrating how building shape changes according to size, and we extend this analysis to the classification of buildings according to land use types.

Then, it discusses what forces determine styles of operation of LSPs, why LSPs encounter difficulties in discussions in the decision making process and why LSPs have difficulties in shaping strategies of the partners' organisations. Firstly, this thesis develops a new evaluation framework for the strategies-making programme and public participation programmes, which may find practical use, based on the literature reviews of both academic research papers and government guidance on participative planning approach. Secondly, through reviews of government guidance on LSP approaches, this thesis established hypotheses for resolving the above mentioned questions by considering the new evaluation framework. Thirdly, in order to verify hypotheses, it uses the results of a questionnaire survey, a one-year observation of the board meetings, and an interview survey which examines the ways that the process operated for the strategy-making in four LSPs in inner London boroughs namely, Camden, Hackney, Lambeth and Wandsworth. It concludes by discussing to extent which LSPs achieve involvement and success in shaping the strategies of the partners.",Participants from these 4 LSPs,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,PhD thesis

Following a literature review, and some definitions of the subject matter, there is an analysis of transport data, including the historic use of motorcycles, and policy documents at a national, regional and local level informs a discussion on the utility of motorcycles within a sustainable transport strategy, and its implementation by London Boroughs. As well as examining travel patterns in London, the thesis details the characteristics of London motorcyclists and what differentiates them from riders elsewhere in the UK. The thesis considers some issues associated with the use of motorcycles that help inform policy and strategy at both the national and the local level. These include safety, emissions, noise, congestion and use of the road space. These issues are then tested through case studies of policies and strategies produced by two the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Harrow. The final section compares the characteristics of motorcycles against the requirements of a sustainable transport system and summarises the positive and negative contributions that motorcycles can make. This thesis attempts to answer the questions: Do motorcycles represent a more sustainable transport mode than the private car in Greater London Could an increase in motorcycle use, at the expense of either car or public transport use, have a significant impact on the sustainability of transport in London Would encouraging motorcycle use present a more sustainable approach to London overall, in terms of secondary environmental measures What role can land-use planning have in assisting motorcycle use The thesis concludes that motorcycles do have a role to play in helping to achieve a more sustainable transport system in London, but this is to some extent, dependent on the type and location of journey the vehicle is used for. The thesis also concludes that increasing motorcycle use would be beneficial to motorcyclists' road safety, and how motorcycling would be a beneficiary of policies intended to reduce car use.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

Through a comparison of two distinctive areas of London - Soho in the West End and the famously poor area of London\'s East End, the analysis shows a consistentcorrespondence between poverty and spatial segregation. Booth\'s economically based \'line of poverty\', used to distinguish between those \'in poverty\' and those living \'in comfort\' is supplemented in this paper by a proposed spatially defined line of poverty, distinguishing between poor, spatiallysegregated streets and more prosperous, spatially integrated streets. Furthermore, through the application of the latest segment angular techniques, space syntax analysis reveals a new finding relating to the formation of poverty areas, which combine low integration with large numbers of small street blocks, suggesting that this combination of spatial factorshelps explain the persistence of poverty and poor quality housing, detrimental to the living standards of the poverty classes. This finding also helps explain how such areas can create a sense of entering \'another world\', with the emergence of sub-cultures and new communities. The paperconcludes with the proposition that when such areas are located close to economically active, well integrated streets, such spatial patterning can serve as a necessary mechanism for the social integration of minorities and is frequently part of a natural process of acculturation and integration in the urban environment.",,,,,,,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,

This is undertaken through an inductive approach in the context of town centre planning and policy in London. The research is led by interviews with a Planning Partner of a large national consultancy based in London specialising in major retail development, a Senior Strategic Planner in the GLA responsible for town centre issues, and the Assistant Director in charge of planning in an inner London borough. Along with other forms of qualitative research, these reveal problems in the conceptual basis of metropolitan retail planning decision taking. This particularly relates to the level of consideration given by planners to the desired organisation of town centre networks. It is found that due to this, the potential 'strategic advantage' of retail coordination at the regional level cannot at present materialise in the metropolis. In contrast local planning authorities, if their capacity is increased, can at least recognise aspects of the possible role of town centres that retail planning has not fully appreciated.","the West End Partner (WEP) at the major planning consultancy

In London, it is beginning to shape estate renewal delivery practices, with the buoyant housing market utilised to deliver the cross subsidy needed to rebuild ailing social housing provision. The Mayor's London Plan is pushing for a more compact city, which along with the 50% target for all housing development to be 'affordable' is also serving to push proposed densities on estate renewal schemes higher. Related to this is the concept of mixing communities to achieve a critical mass of social change and alleviate so called negative 'area effects'. While a range of policy goals are suggested in the pursuit of such policies, the government has not been explicit in setting clear objectives against which policy delivery can be tested. This dissertation analyses current research into high density and mixed tenure development. It seeks to better understand the impacts when the two outcomes are combined in the London context. Six case studies taken from current research are analysed against the proposed Woodberry Down estate renewal scheme, one of a number of emerging redevelopment projects based on emerging delivery practices towards high density, mixed tenure communities. A range of barriers to effective implementation are identified, which could impact upon identified goals. The reality is that as pressure grows to deliver more housing and facilities, with less land and government subsidy, these barriers will be traded off each other by local politicians in the hope of achieving the best possible outcome under increasingly difficult circumstances. Key to this is the need to engender strong local leadership, public sector control, a proactive planning system and economic viability, both in terms of initial scheme costs and longer term management.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

Urban design, applied with the aim of enhancing a sense of place, may also be particularly important in the traditionally 'placeless' suburban context. Following the 2004 Planning and Compensation Act, urban design frameworks began to emerge for suburban town centres in London. They are important and demand analysis, because they represent modern urban design in London moving beyond the city core into mixed-use suburban areas. Any analysis of this phenomenon must also include awareness of the implications of the London Plan, setting as it does the strategic planning context for all suburban design frameworks. Three differing case study design frameworks were selected for detailed investigation. In most cases, micro-scale design objectives within the study area were well-formulated. However, issues relating to their wider context often appeared problematic, notably the frameworks' relationship with neighbouring centres, enhancement of local distinctiveness, and their attitude towards environmental sustainability. With the relatively monocentric London Plan ignoring the important potential contribution of London's suburbs to city-region growth and sustainability, the regional planning context thus generated encourages the pariochiality highlighted within the case study design frameworks. A realignment of regional policy, particularly the formulation of strategic design goals, might offer suburban town centres more opportunity to contribute to London's growth and sustainability. According to case study evidence, such realignment should incorporate promotion of orbital public transport corridors, coordination of complementary or 'niche' roles for town centres enhancing any existing local sense of place, and top-down integration of environmental sustainability from regional to local level. This new strategic planning and design context might represent an achievable first stage towards a more sustainable, polycentric pattern of development for London.","Stewart Clark of the London Borough of Bromley,

Previous work on housing management has tended to focus on the adoption of new public management principles, assuming that policy from 1988 has resulted in a cultural shift towards individualism. This study makes use of 'grid-group' cultural theory to challenge this assumption by tracking all four 'cultures' within housing association management: egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism as well as individualism. As a detailed qualitative analysis of the voluntary housing sector, it addresses a neglected field of study within public policy. London provides rich ground for analysis of cultural change in the voluntary housing sector. It has a higher concentration of housing associations than any other UK city, it is where most of the larger housing organisations originated and it is the site of the greatest development activity throughout the period. London housing associations encapsulate all the significant changes in housing management resulting from the reforms of the 1980s. Whilst the study finds evidence of individualistic philosophy, particularly amongst senior housing association managers, it also finds evidence of egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism. Egalitarianism remains as the legacy of housing associations' historical origins and organisational structures. Hierarchy results from an increasingly dominant role for a small number of large, elite organisations, which become more hierarchical as they grow. Fatalism has emerged as a prevalent ethos amongst front-line staff, reflected and reinforced by the increasingly negative experience of residents. The thesis reveals how, contrary to the expectations of the 1988 Act, an overall shift 'up-grid' towards hierarchalism and fatalism emerged as the most significant response.",48 local participants,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities,,,,Discovery,PhD thesis

New institutional landscapes are being formed across London and power is increasingly diffused across multiple sectors under a new multi-level network pattern of governance. The new institutional arrangements for London and the inauguration of the Greater London Authority in particular embody the contradictory New Labour modernisation agenda displaying evidence of centralism, managerialism and localism at the same time (Brooks, 1999). In London Thames Gateway the omnipresence of the central state is revealed despite the 'devolution' of power to a new citywide Mayor. This also suggests that Government is increasingly being 'hollowed-out' (Houghton and Counsell, 2004) but that central Government continues to 'steer' the course. If the last few years are anything to go by spatial planning and strategic planning projects in particular, are back in vogue. As in the post-war period London is faced with a projected population and jobs explosion, although for very different reasons. 'Big bang' strategic planning has returned with a vengeance but for London Thames Gateway the same old questions remain: delivery---how, who and where The current institutional apparatus continues to confuse and bemuse and this study is about contributing towards the task of converting paper plans and a multitude of competing urban visions into lived reality. A broader reconfiguration of the state, economy and civil society means that a more sophisticated understanding is required to get to grips with the different actors involved within networks and the relationships of these networks. In the context of institutional fragmentation London Thames Gateway is used as a 'window' into the current institutional framework to see how the New Labour modernisation agenda is working 'on the ground'. The study uses semi-structured interviews across the various governance tiers (i.e. central Government, pan-London and sub-regional levels) to analyse the internal and external working relationships of the various actors involved. The analysis suggests that for those organisations involved in London Thames Gateway there is a 'sense of a widely-held common project' (Amin and Thrift 1995) and that this is the 'institutional glue' that binds these organisations together. In this sense the study draws on anthropology by isolating typologies or generic characteristics to understand what binds (or not) these institutions together. The evidence also suggests that participation in developing an urban vision for London Thames Gateway has broadened to encompass sectors (such as the health sector) previously neglected in planning processes and this is a positive aspect of the reforms. In an analysis of the proposed Urban Development Corporation a number of positive (generic) components can be identified. However, the analysis also emphasises that the New Labour modernisation programme is likely to generate significant tensions and some of these are in evidence in London Thames Gateway. This is because the many changes and innovations that result from this programme are creating new institutional arrangements and there is evidence of competing cultures as emerging institutions bring with them a whole new set of values and rules-in-use. These new governance structures can be linked to London's position within the global economy, the 'flavour' of the new planning system and the spatial plans being produced to take account of these trends. The global economic race for economic competitiveness dictates that planners and planning must respond, whilst at the same time steering a course through social cohesion and environmental sustainability. It is argued that there is no spatial fait accompli and political institutions and civil society in London Thames Gateway are able to manoeuvre to steer these forces in a positive direction. And so, the broader of role of planners and their ability to deliver through these emerging institutional mechanisms is brought into question. In so doing we argue that this has forced them to cast aside traditional working practices and to develop new approaches to ensuring economic, environmental and social objectives are met through the prism of spatial planning.","

The first chapter gives an overview of the aspects of Deleuze's philosophy, which are of particular interest in the context of architectural theory. The main postulates of transcendental empiricism are explained, followed by the four major concepts: space, time, image and event. The second chapter deals with Deleuze's understanding of the cinematic frame. The relationship between the frame and the content of framing is shown as possibly inherently dynamic. A description of the major points regarding the Underground corridor follows, with the explanation of the condition of the walking body and its relation to the surrounds. Finally, the notion of the cinematic frame and acts of framing are utilised for the conceptualisation of the Underground corridor, showing the notion of movement to be of crucial importance. Chapter three regards the platform event in relation to the cinematic shot, which is explained to be a matter of conversion of movement. The specificity of the Underground platform is related, and the relationship between the body and the moving object of the train explained. The conjunction between the platform and the shot is then proposed, to show that the platform stands at a point of conversion of movement, transforming body's relationship to its environment. Chapter four is the discussion of the Underground carriage, and its understanding in the light of Deleuze's conceptualisation of the cinematic close-up. The close-up is shown to represent a specific, qualitative transformation, which marks the shift of movement in the direction of expression. The concept of any-space-whatever is then related as an example of Deleuze's transformation of the close-up of the face to the object and then to a spatial figure. The specifics of the Underground carriage are related, introducing the notion of the motionless body inside a moving confinement, as well as the presentation of 'facialisation.' The third part of the chapter sees the explanation of the carriage event in the light of the close-up/affection-image, and it pays special attention to the transformation of movement into expression. Finally, Chapter Five sees the discussion of the Underground in general, and its relation to the city. Deleuze's understanding of the concept of montage is explained in particular its relationship to time and construction of continuities and wholes across ruptures.

It examines the way in which London borough councils have utilised the planning system in order to maximise affordable housing completions. It particular, it considers the way in which 'payments in lieu' (PiL) have contributed to the supply of affordable accommodation. This thesis assesses the planning policy framework for affordable housing provision in London. It also investigates past and current borough practices in respect of the implementation of these policies. This analysis includes an appraisal of the quantitative outputs of the planning system, including the particular contributions that have been forthcoming from PiL finances. The primary research for this thesis comprises a questionnaire survey of the thirty-three London boroughs and a number of case study planning applications involving PiL agreements. In addition, a range of secondary data sources are used in the analysis and evaluation, including Government 'Housing Investment Programme' (HIP) data. The findings of this thesis are considered in the light of the contemporary debate regarding the future of the system of planning obligations in the UK. The benefits and disadvantages of the current approach to seeking affordable housing provision through the planning system are evaluated within this wider context. This leads into an assessment of the various alternative policy approaches that could be adopted by the Government in relation to planning obligations, with particular reference to the issue of affordable housing contributions.",Local officers,,Anonymous Public Engagement,,,Anonymous Public Engagement ,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

The approach used for modelling is Multiple Regression Analysis of independent variables against the dependent variable of observed pedestrian flows. The test samples were from manual observation studies of average total pedestrian flow per hour on 237 sample sites. The model will provide predicted flow values for all 7,526 street segments in the 25 square kilometres of Central London. It has been independently validated by Transport for London and is being tested against further observation data. The longer term aim is to extend the model to the entire greater London area and to incorporate additional policy levers for use as a transport planning and evaluation tool.","1. Jake Desyllas

For the past thirty years, the interwar suburbs of North West London have seen a changing population, rising levels of deprivation and a deteriorating built environment. Exploring these changes and the role of local centres as foci for regeneration and revitalisation, twelve centres are investigated and their suitability for development assessed in the context of the draft Spatial Development Strategy for London. A new approach to suburban planning is proposed linking the changing condition of centres and the character of the surrounding neighbourhoods to develop more effective sub-regional planning policies.",,,,,,N/A,,,,Planning and Policy,,,,Discovery,Master thesis

This is because different organisations, (both private companies andpublic bodies) hold environmental information relating to London and rarelyintegrate this information. In some instances free public access to thisinformation is not possible. In other situations, access is possible, but theinformation is often stored in a ?user unfriendly format?. This may beincomprehensible ?tabular? data, or data that is stored in a format that requiresthe user to purchase specialist software before attempting to view theinformation. Environmental Information Systems aim to integrate and improveaccess to this information and provide a variety of tools and technologies toassist the management and use of environmentally related data andinformation.This project aims to bring together some of this environmental data for Londonand provide access to it in an easier format. The main goal was to develop aprototype Environmental Information System for London. The system shoulddemonstrate how it is possible to combine information and provide a greaterinsight into London?s environmental situation. The system should alsocommunicate environmental information about London to a potentially ?wideranging audience? in an easy to use and intuitive manner.The outcome was London Environmental Information System or ?LondonEnvironment Online? (LEO) as it has been named. The naming includes theword ?Online? because it a new breed of Environmental Information Systemthat operates over the Internet or World Wide Web. This addresses severalissues since it allows a large number of people to access the system from avariety of locations. It also means that, although the core of the systemdepends upon expensive and powerful software packages, hardware anddatabases, the data within this can be used via a basic ?Internet Browser? or?Web Browser?. Web Browsers are typically free and commonly used on mostdesktop computers around the world to day.The report itself is directed to stakeholders involved in the monitoring andmanagement of the London environment. This ranges from senior politiciansand ministers responsible for implementing environmental policy to thosecollecting the basic data in the field and those responsible for storing anddisseminating this information. Particularly, the document is directed at centraland local government departments in their role as environmental decisionmakersand managers. It is also of interest to public watchdogs, communityorganisations and non-government organisations (NGO?s) interested in toolsfor supplying environmental information.","Jackson Environment Institute

While it is now widely speculated that this is causing gentrification and displacement, the extent to which it has forced low-income households to move away from their local community remains to a large degree conjectural and specific to those estates that have undergone special scrutiny. Given the lack of spatially disaggregated migration data that allows us to study patterns of dispersal from individual estates, in this article, we report on an attempt to use consumer-derived data (LCRs) to infer relocations at a high spatial resolution. The evidence presented suggests that around 85% of those displaced remain in London, with most remaining in borough, albeit there is evidence of an increasing number of moves out of London to the South-East and East of England.","1.

This collaborative public history project 'City of Women London' aimed to redraw and reimagine the classic London Underground map to produce an alternative map, replacing existing station names with the names of remarkable female or non-binary Londoners who have had an impact on the city’s history. 

Led by writer Reni Eddo-Lodge and actor Emma Watson, who worked with writer and activist Rebecca Solnit and partnered with Transport for London (TfL), the project – called City of Women – draws from figures in arts, sports, activism, science, media, law, medicine and beyond. The digital version, led by Dr Leah Lovett (UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis), allows people to learn more about each person and their lives. The online map launches with featured biographies and interviews from contemporary women and non-binary people.

The project aims to identify remarkable female or non-binary Londoners who have had an impact on the city’s history in some way. It allocates them to each of the stations depicted on the London Tube map according to their connections to a local area. Some of these people might be household names, others unsung heroes or figures from London’s hidden histories. The names are drawn from arts, civil society, business, politics, sport, with suggestions gathered by consulting with historians, writers, curators, community organisers, women’s rights organisations, museums, and librarians and through an open call to the public to submit ideas. 

The interactive City of Women London map has been developed by Dr Leah Lovett, Dr Duncan Hay, and Montaz Marche from the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) using Memory Mapper, an open source toolkit for mapping stories of place developed at CASA.","Reni Eddo-Lodge (writer)

It can be tailored to different places and for different purposes to manage various types of greenspaces and to engage people about the important relationship between health and parks. 

Their online interactive platform is designed to embed their work within wider policy and practice ecosystems.

The proposed framework will leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, land use transport modelling, and urban planning. Under this theoretical framework, new variability measures will be developed and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models. These urban models will generate a more accurate evaluation of land use and transport impacts on people’s mobility patterns in terms of the affected area and effect time. Case studies in three typical urban contexts (i.e. London, Shenzhen, and Nairobi) will be explored to demonstrate the feasibility and generic applicability of the proposed framework, analytical methods and urban models.",,,,,,,,,,,European Research Council (ERC),,,Worktribe ,

Tanhua Jin ",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"The concept of the 15-minute city was developed for inner city districts in major metropolitan centres, but it is also highly relevant to outer metropolitan areas and smaller towns and cities to foster more sustainable travel behaviour. Yet, the latter areas often have additional sustainability challenges including greater car dependence, struggling local retail centres, disintegrated housing developments and weaker active travel infrastructure. The ENHANCE project is designed to understand the barriers for the application of 15mC principles in outer metropolitan areas and small cities and provide evidence to improve local planning decision-making. This will be achieved through three main tasks:

1. Creating multi-modal composite accessibility indicators that capture progress towards 15-minute city goals and that highlight the degree to which daily travel needs can potentially be fulfilled within local trips.

2. Analysing actual travel behaviour in relation to the 15-minute city objectives to describe the degree to which different societal groups fulfil their daily travel needs by local trips in practice and to understand current barriers to meeting sustainable travel objectives.

3. Develop a modelling environment that allows the development of future scenarios that enhance accessibility by the provision of transport infrastructure, adapting travel behaviour or (re)developing the city.","Prospective Labs

The growth of these mega-city regions is heavily influenced by the fusion of existing cities as well as by rapid continental scale migration. This growth is generating severe problems of social segregation, connectivity, mobility, and income inequalities that require new and powerful methods of analytical understanding such as those being developed using real-time ‘big’ data sources and new information technologies. We propose to develop a platform for prediction and urban governance using the Pearl River Delta ‘Greater Bay Area’ mega-city region as a demonstrator, bringing sustainability indicators and simulation models from the Greater London and urban Holland (the Randstad) regions to inform the development of an urban data and simulation platform relevant to designing and testing scenarios for new modes of transport and the alleviation of socio-economic inequalities in the Bay Area. These problems, we believe, will be key mega-city regions during the rest of this century.","Dr. Joana Barros ( Department of Geography, Birkbeck)

Adam Dennett",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"""VU.CITY has created the largest, most accurate and truly interactive digital city model, which provides a revolutionary tool for architects, developers, advisors and the public sector.

VU.CITY saves time and money for anyone involved in planning or development and is directly leading to better decision making, with 18 of 33 London councils already using it. Using game engine technology, users can import their own 3D model into VU.CITY to immediately place their proposals in context and test their visual impact. VU.CITY is fast becoming the industry standard method of considering development plans. The presentation of proposals through VU.CITY will speed up and increase engagement in mandatory public consultations and is already helping councillors make better, more informed decisions in planning committee meetings.

Colouring London (CL) is a web based Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiative, designed by the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), UCL, and created in collaboration with Historic England. Approximately 12 categories of data are being crowdsourced including building age, use, type size, designation status and rebuild history. CL is providing the first ever public resource, and first port of call, for data on the characteristics of London's building stock.

CL is currently limited to 2D maps. The proposed project will develop an API to feed CL data directly into VU.CITY to be visualised in 3D. The project also aims to create an app based version of VU.CITY to work on mobile phones (YOUR.VU.CITY). This will enable members of the public to view proposed developments from their current geographical location. The user will simply point their smart phone in the direction of the proposed development site and it will appear within the screen view. Users will be able to provide feedback on the proposed development through the app. Based on the feedback, developers will be able to revise their proposalst. Similarly, developers will be able to receive suggestions and feedback on mixed-use community development sites from potential end users.","VUCITY LIMITED

These include procedures like the standard eye test and photographs taken of the eye to less heard of procedures like the Humphrey Field Analyser and the ORA. What is fundamental about these outpatient clinics is that each patient runs through the same procedures every visit. This means that the patients and the technician running the procedures go through very similar flows and patterns that can be optimised given the right technology and opportunities.  
This is precisely the problem that Project Hercules is attempting to solve. Using the pop-up clinic located at Brent Cross, which is easily reconfigurable and allows multiple different floor plans to be tested, the Project Hercules team aims to build a safer and more efficient clinic. Consenting patient and technician movements will be tracked using highly specialised Ubisense Ultra-Wideband sensors. Monitoring and recording people within a metre, these sensors will provide granular location data, which can be analysed on its own, aggregated to understand problematic areas or to potentially uncover what makes one layout much more efficient than another. In combination with in-person ethnographic observations and measurements of environmental conditions such as CO2 levels, these analyses will be a fundamental part of how future Moorfields Eye Hospital clinics will be designed in the future."," Hari Jayaram (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust )

Previous research (Sendra, 2018) has shown the lack of genuine participation of residents in estate regeneration, which is often limited to a superficial consultation, to a tokenistic approach, or to voting yes or no to predefined proposals with little resident input. Research has also shown the capacity of residents to self-organise, contest top-down schemes, and propose community-led alternative approaches (Sendra & Fitzpatrick, 2020). The aim of this research project is to co-produce with residents and communities a brief for the regeneration of the Trellick Tower and Cheltenham Estate, which includes how the process should be, how communities should participate in decision-making, how the process should reach the diversity of communities in the area, which are the spaces that people value, what needs to improve, and what kind of development they would want. For achieving these objectives, the project will use a Participatory Action Research approach, where the research outputs are co-produced with the communities affected.

Proponents of the smart city concept claim that a smart city can help solve urban problems such as environmental unsustainability, traffic congestion, crime, alienation of underprivileged groups in political decision-making, and pandemic. However, sceptics are concerned about the big data firms' appropriation of the data generated by citizens, the seduced consumption caused by big data- informed advertisements, and the violations of privacy by enhanced surveillance systems, among others. It is our view that a humanised vision for the smart city requires a more contextualised understanding of the current smart city practices. We have planned long-term interdisciplinary research, the first step of which is the current workshop series.

Callum Ward",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"This proposal draws on a precise comparative, inter-disciplinary methodology to examine the inter-relationships between contemporary investment flows into the housing markets of major cities and the governance arrangements and public policy instruments that are designed to regulate them. Our case studies are three of Europe's leading urban centres: the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area; Greater London; and Grand Paris.

The proposal is timely as major cities have been faced with unprecedented development pressures. Their populations and economies have expanded and their envrionments have become highly attractive locations for global and national financial investment. These pressures have been particularly acute in the production and consumption of housing, where the impacts of investments on markets, citizens, and places are generating a widely perceived 'crisis' and set of new challenges for policy-makers and planners. There is a growing urgency to produce affordable housing for a variety of groups in order for cities to maintain their growth and to meet the needs of their citizens. A failure to tackle housing problems will both limit future growth potential and act as a source of social conflict and discontent.

The proposal draws on two streams of analysis. First we examine investment landscapes and the effectiveness of regulations and policy instruments that are designed to control them. We do this systematically and comparatively. Second we analyse the types of investment that are shaping housing markets and their impacts on people and places. We explore its sources, objectives, and designed outcomes.

The research meets an increasingly urgent need to develop better understandings of the complex relationships between markets, planning controls, and the quality of life of citizens in a context of escalating political tensions between different socio-economic groups and major global economic and social changes.",,,,,,,,,,Planning and Policy,UK Research and Innovation ,,,Worktribe ,

Tatiana Moreira de Souza",,,Bartlett School of Planning,"The short-term renting of a property to visitors is not new. However, the rise of internet-based platforms — digital marketplaces that match supply and demand — has fuelled the diversification and expansion of this practice in an unprecedented way. The market leader in the short-term accommodation sector is Airbnb, created in 2008 to allow landlords and tenants to advertise their homes for short-term rental. There now exists a variety of short-term rental platforms that differ in terms of their business models (peer-to-peer, business-to-consumer or both), their links with giants of the online travel industry, their geographical coverage and the types of accommodation they offer. Their offer has grown rapidly over the past decade, although interrupted in 2020 by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The likelihood is that as recovery from the pandemic comes about, the short-term rental market will rebound. This project analyses and compares how public actors in large European cities have attempted to regulate platform-mediated short-term rentals, and outlines which implementation and enforcement challenges they have faced in doing so. The objectives of the research were to:
Identify the different types, and arguments, of interest groups and stakeholders who have been advocating or opposing the regulation of platform-mediated short-term rentals;
Identify the regulations put in place in large European cities to manage or control the phenomenon, and compare their instruments, modalities and degrees of stringency;
Assess how public authorities perceive the effectiveness of the regulations to date and identify the challenges they face in terms of implementation and enforcement.","HospitalityUK

The Stockholm region is growing rapidly and so, a significant housing shortage has become apparent. Housing prices and costs have been skyrocketing, with apartment prices having increased by 200% in a decade; and ‘social renting’ lists of up to two decades waiting time. The London metropolitan area has also seen a notable rise in population in recent years and this has increased prices to unprecedented levels and made it difficult for vulnerable households to access housing.

Both cities have earmarked densification of core urban areas and new housing development as solutions to this problem: in Stockholm, densification takes place within strategic nodes connected by transport corridors, forming a star shaped metropolitan structure delimited by ten green edges, while in London, a range of densification options have been deployed, from building tall to the purchase of social housing estates by private developers for new private denser residential development.

Urban densification has been seen as an approach to counteract urban sprawl and deliver sustainable development via more compact cities which facilitate more efficient transportation and use of resources. This thinking has been combined with the orthodoxy of public space at human-scale or ‘cities for people’ to accommodate for the diversity of users and allow for positive social interactions in the urban environment. Both Stockholm and London have been using social sustainability and placemaking ideas to deliver denser as well as vibrant and socially viable urban environment and housing.

Anecdotal evidence, however, points to the fact that in both cities the social sustainability agenda is used as a ‘veiled declaration’ for property-led development, which in turn is often connected to negative social impacts such as spatial displacement and segregation, gentrification and urban inequality. Moreover, placemaking is criticised for being aimed at ‘place-promotion’ and ‘selling-the-city’, and used by the two cities (and their developers) to increase property prices (and returns) at the cost of low income households. Hence, this project aims to answer two questions from a comparative perspective:

Q1: What & where: What type of and where housing is delivered via densification in Stockholm and London?; and

Q2: How & For Whom: What role do the social sustainability and placemaking agendas play in shaping housing outputs and meeting housing need in Stockholm and London?",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,KTH Royal Institute of Technology,,,Worktribe ,

The large amount of capital for infrastructure projects is tightly aligned with the fast and exponential global population growth, which, according to the United Nations, will reach 8 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Considering the high rate of budget overruns and delays in megaprojects, it is important to explore in depth the potential of innovative client models to deliver megaprojects. Considering the global infrastructure pipeline forecasted for the next decades, this research explores the formation of megaproject client organizations, which are new, dedicated, and often temporary entities created to deliver the project on behalf of the sponsor. The research is novel as it investigates three megaprojects in real time and adopts a supply chain management lens to conceptualize the formation and evolution of inter-organizational relationships. It contributes to two literatures, construction supply chain management and project delivery models, by exploring the megaproject client organization as the focal firm and its strategies to design the supply chain architecture. It builds upon previous research by exploring a different challenge to manage the supply chain in one-off settings, exploring the concurrent formation of a new entity and its supply chain strategies. Six megaprojects that at the time represented a combined investment of £93.93 billion have been analyzed in the United Kingdom: High Speed 1 (£6.16 billion), Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 (£4.3 billion), London 2012 Olympics (£8.77 billion), Crossrail (£14.8 billion), Thames Tideway Tunnel (£4.2 billion), and High Speed 2 (£55.7 billion). The empirical data were collected through 210 semistructured interviews with senior megaproject leaders. Key research findings include: (i) the identification of the megaproject multilayer and multilevel organizational structure, identifying multiple organizational roles and responsibilities; (ii) understanding of the terminologies of owners, sponsors, clients, and operators in megaprojects, as well as the dynamics of its nonstatic and evolutionary nature throughout the project life cycle, unpacking who does what, when, how, and why; (iii) the process of the formation of temporary client organizations and the dimensions of the rationale behind the strategic decisions over time, in light of the plurality of potential integration methods between client and delivery partners; (iv) the importance of a clearly defined governance structure and recommendations to organize the inter-organizational relationships between sponsors, clients, delivery partners, and the supply chain. This research improves the understanding of the formation and evolution of megaproject client organizations, illustrating how the emerging temporary organizations design the supply chain architecture and the dynamics of the associated inter-organizational relationships. The research contributes toward a more informed, systemic strategic decision making by the client organization, impacting the inter-organizational relationships with the supply chain to improve megaproject delivery. Considering the sequential development of these projects, there is an opportunity to understand the evolution of the UK market as a client in delivering megaprojects, exploring the similarities and differences of the inter-organizational structures created over time. The aim is to provide guidance for megaproject promoters, policy makers, and practitioners in their strategic decisions in the front-end of those projects, increasing the knowledge of innovative structures to address the increasing global investment in megaprojects.",,,,,,,,,,Construction and Engineering ,Project Management Institute,Major Projects Association,CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) ,Worktribe ,

The circular bioeconomy restores local ecosystems to benefit local food production, wildlife, flood management, soil quality, aid in carbon sequestration and provide recreational opportunities for local people. It also harvests organic waste to produce feedstock, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and produce bioenergy. These activities offer new economic opportunities for residents living near the Estuary.

The team will create a living lab in the Thames Estuary to explore the potential for creating a circular bioeconomy of wellbeing. It will engage with local stakeholders and seek to develop experimental projects with them to benefit the local community.

The team will also develop an educational programme for young people living near the estuary, so they too can be part of his transformation process. The team will monitor the ecological and social impact of these efforts and further explore their potential to transform the Thames Estuary.",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),,,Worktribe ,

Working with partner cities in France, China and Kenya, the project will assist decision-makers and the public about areas of development that afford the greatest opportunities for health and sustainability.
CUSSH aims to conduct research and improve capacity to guide transformational changes in cities to meet environmental imperatives and improve the health and wellbeing of current and future populations by harnessing the benefits of sustainable policies and minimizing potential adverse consequences of global technological, environmental and social change.


Project details

CUSSH will develop critical evidence on how to achieve the far-reaching transformation of cities needed to address vital environmental imperatives for population and planetary health in the 21st century. We will use cutting-edge science and systems-based participatory methods to articulate visions of development, help shape policy decisions, and accelerate the implementation of transformational changes for health and sustainability in low, middle and high-income settings.

The negative environmental consequences of human activity represent an unprecedented threat to human health and well-being. Yet, to date no city has succeeded in implementing a pathway of development that is consistently and demonstrably on track to deliver long-term environment and health goals that fulfil both local needs and the increasingly urgent imperatives for planetary health.

In the CUSSH project we will:

Articulate the opportunities for achieving major health and sustainability objectives through urban development
Use research evidence to inform decision-makers and the public about the pathways of development that provide the greatest opportunities for health and sustainability, and to track progress towards the fulfilment of agreed goals
Identify the methods and factors crucial to successful implementation of development strategies that take full account of the needs and opportunities for health and sustainability in urban living",,,,,,,,,,Sustainability ,Wellcome Trust,,,Worktribe ,

The research involves co-creating a web-based and end-user led prototype called a virtual decision room (VDR) to help movements towards a sustainable digital society. The VDR will be co-created with local government, the local community, regulators and water utility companies ('end-users') to collaboratively plan and evaluate the environmental sustainability of urban growth planning scenarios using co-designed water neutrality indicators during the project. The VDR will use a whole-water system Digital Twin (FuturaWat) that supports evidence-led water neutral planning for place making. This will be achieved by integrating two state-of-art digital tools: GIS-based ground risk calculator (GRISC) and whole-water system model (CityWat) with a participatory process to facilitate end-user discussion and decision-making on housing and water system planning scenarios. The key novelty of the proposed research is in applying systems approaches to infrastructure planning, collaborative working and sustainability evaluation.

The VDR will be tested by applying it to Greater Manchester and London Borough of Enfield case study examples to enable end-users to align their strategic planning and water management priorities. The VENTURA concept was co-developed with our project partners, who have helped us formulate Greater Manchester (GM) and London Borough of Enfield (LBE) case examples. In GM the work will directly support the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) 'levelling up' strategies and help them to holistically address 'challenges to delivery when considering wider issues such as flood risk, brownfield land remediation, environmental degradation and wider resilience to climate change'. The LBE case example will support Enfield Council in their transition to a digital platform that will enable correlation of infrastructure needs with investment opportunities and help them to more effectively engage with local communities and discuss local plans, which currently do not include water demand and water quality evaluation because of lack of evidence. Both case examples will explicitly account for community perspectives through collaborations with partner local NGOs: Thames21 (LBE) and The Mersey Rivers Trust (GM).

VENTURA directly addresses the current UK Government's high-profile strategic initiatives including 'Planning for the future' White Paper and the National Digital Twin Programme. In particular, VENTURA provides a proof-of-concept for the White Paper's highly ambitious proposals that seek to reduce the duration of the planning cycle significantly, supporting net gains in the quality of the environment and front-loading public engagement in the planning system to the plan-making stage of place-making.

The research will adapt traditional working practices to help the work become more sustainable. This will be formalised through the development of a sustainability policy for the research and will include initiatives such as monitoring and managing environmental performance by embedding into project management, reporting progress and sharing good practice with other EPSRC projects.",Enfield Council,"(51.6549375, -0.0803125)",,,,Collaborators,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with other partner(s),,Planning and Policy,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Worktribe ,

It often coincides with and contributes to other housing problems, such as damp and mould. It is a risk factor for many health outcomes including infections, injuries, and poor mental health. 
For councils to alleviate the effects of overcrowding, new methods are required to identify which houses are overcrowded and how it affects residents. In particular, existing measures are not tailored to particular populations, such as families, where overcrowding limits children’s ability to play and study.

What are we seeking to do? In this feasibility study, we are seeking to develop a method to identify households with families at high risk of overcrowding affecting their wellbeing.

Objectives:
Agree on a definition of household overcrowding affecting family wellbeing with people that have lived experience of overcrowding
Operationalize this measure in one council by combining publicly available and council-held data to identify households with families at risk of the health effects of overcrowding
Understand the wider applicability of this measure with other councils and its implications for population-level intervention design

Methods: A mixed methods design will be used. A resident engagement approach will be taken throughout the project. This considers families with lived experience of overcrowding and community representatives as partners in the project, alongside service professionals and researchers. From discussions with these groups, a description and definition of overcrowding affecting households with families will be produced. Based on this definition, data available to the council will be combined and analyzed quantitatively to provide a composite measure of household overcrowding affecting family wellbeing. The methods and illustrative results from one council will be shared with other councils, with a short survey to understand its wider applicability.

Anticipated impact and dissemination: For councils, the project will provide a feasible method of identifying areas of potential overcrowding affecting the health of families in their area. Longer term, it will enable councils to design and target interventions to alleviate the effects of overcrowding and that may increase the wellbeing of families. Guidance will be produced and disseminated through council and public health networks. 
For lived experience volunteers, the project should immediately provide the sense of feeling heard. Longer term, their views will have an influence on local and wider policy. Lay summaries in visual forms (e.g., video) will be developed with lived experience partners and disseminated via HealthWatch networks. 
For research, this project will advance our understanding of methods to identify overcrowding affecting specific populations. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conferences.",,,,,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),Co-authorship with charity,,,Health,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR),,,Worktribe ,

However, there is a lack of research on their value and use. Indicator producers, often from health fields, tend to have a linear and rational view of indicator use and policy-making that is starkly contrasted by urban policy scholars who see these processes as complex and socially constructed. It is therefore unclear how UHI tools might function within the complex planning policy and decision-making process to promote health considerations. This mixed-methods research investigates the use and value of UHI tools using collaborative rationality and systems theories. A two-part systematic review included a census of 145 UHI tools and a narrative synthesis of 10 qualitative studies on the use of UHI tools. The results were used to develop a taxonomy of UHI tools and theory of change. A series of 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with indicator producers and users in San Francisco, Melbourne and Sydney. These data were analysed using thematic analysis and systems thinking approaches to produce causal loop diagrams (CLD) of participants’ mental models. The CLDs were tested and improved in a participatory modelling workshop. Indicator users and producers had significant overlap in their mental models. The development and application of UHI tools increased inter-sectoral relationships which supported actors to better understand each other’s opportunities and constraints for health promotion. Relationships helped to create new advocates for health in diverse organisations, supporting health in all policies or whole-of-society approaches to health promotion. Community involvement in UHI tools and the effectiveness of advocates helped to challenge constraints to health-promoting policy development and implementation. However, the high number of new indicators being created can create confusion and reduce indicator use, particularly when they are not designed to meet users’ needs.",,,,,,,,,,Health,Building Research Establishment Ltd,,,Worktribe ,

Understanding the factors that contribute to high indoor temperatures in care homes is crucial in developing strategies to avoid summertime overheating and the associated negative health impacts, which are expected to intensify as a result of climate change. The pilot project is undertaking preliminary work in five care settings in London to monitor the summertime conditions experienced by residents and staff, model future overheating risks and investigate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the risk of overheating. It will then bring together the learning from monitoring and modelling in expert workshops to explore the implications for guidelines and regulations, and the potential for scaling-up the project to a national scale. The work will be of interest to relevant stakeholders from the built environment, social care, public health and policy development.

As a result of global climate change, the UK is expected to experience hotter and drier summers and heatwaves are expected to occur with greater frequency, intensity and duration. According to recent climate change projections by the Met Office, increases in mean daily temperatures could be up to 5.4 deg. C during the summer months and 4.2 deg. C during winter by 2070 under a high emissions scenario. In 2003, 2,091 heat-related deaths were reported in the UK alone as a result of the European heatwave, meaning future temperature increases could lead to a parallel rise in heat-related mortality. The UK also currently has a rapidly growing number of old people, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035, compared with 8% in 2012. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The 2003 heatwave demonstrated that older people in care settings are at the highest risk of heat-related mortality. People aged over 65 years spend more than 80% of their time in residential environments or care settings, and people aged over 85 years more than 90%. Therefore, the indoor environment is a huge moderator of heat exposure in older populations: poor building design and the lack of effective heat management in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents. Care facilities function as both a home for residents and a workplace for staff, meaning that the people sharing those spaces can have diverging needs and preferences making overheating prevention measures difficult to enforce. Interactions between staff and residents play an important role in preventing overheating in care settings and it has previously been noted that staff are often made to prioritise warmth due to wide recognition of the detrimental effect cold weather can have on old-age health, leading to overheating risks being overlooked. Understanding factors that contribute to indoor summertime overheating in care homes is crucial in developing methods to prevent overheating and the subsequent negative health impacts.

Previous research by the applicants has indicated that care facilities are already overheating even under non-extreme summers, highlighting the need to develop timely prevention measures given the way temperatures are expected to rise in the UK over the next century. A key target for climate adaptation in care settings is to limit such risks by introducing passive cooling strategies via building design and occupant behaviour. Development of passive cooling strategies will reduce the likelihood of uptake of mechanical cooling, which would undermine government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the principal aim of the project is to undertake preliminary work to develop methods that will support a system of care provision in the UK that is adequately prepared for rising heat stress under climate change. The project will undertake pilot work in five care settings in the UK to monitor the thermal environment and conduct surveys with residents, frontline care staff and care home managers. Within these buildings, it will test novel approaches for understanding the comfort levels of the residents and relating this to the thermal environment. It will also test novel measurement techniques for assessing impact of heat on the health of the residents. Via detailed modelling work, it will then test methods to assess future overheating risks and to evaluate the effectiveness of overheating mitigation strategies. Throughout the project the work will bring together multidisciplinary research perspectives with those of care home practitioners and other stakeholders. Via these packages of work, plans for the large-scale project that is so urgently needed in this area will be developed.","Emer O'Connell (Public Health England)

This information can be effectively used to plan both ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. The Jewel Tower in London, our case study, is digitised using combined laser scanning and photogrammetry, and a virtual model is produced. The point cloud derived from combined laser scanning & photogrammetry is traced out in with Autodesk Revit, where the main volumetry (gross walls and floors) is created with parametric objects. Surface characterisation of the façade is given through renderings. Specifically, new rendering materials have been created for this purpose, based on rectified photos of the Tower. The model is then integrated with moisture data, organised in spreadsheets and linked to it via parametric objects representing the points where measurements had been previously taken.

Exposure to risk factors such as air pollution, hot and cold weather and extreme events can cause reductions in general health and wellbeing, illness, hospitalization and even death. In the UK, an estimated 29,000 deaths are associated with particulate matter (PM) air pollution each year. In August 2003, a severe heatwave across Europe led to over 2,000 deaths in England, and 15,000 in France. It is estimated that this heatwave was responsible for up to 70,000 deaths over Europe as a whole.

Urban populations are especially vulnerable to the risks from environmental hazards. For example, air pollution tends to be higher in cities, and the extra warming due to the urban heat island effect (which describes the increased temperature experienced in towns and cities compared with rural areas) leads to heat-related health impacts, including mortality. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) interacts with air pollution and can make it worse in cities, especially during heatwaves. Urban surfaces can even interact with weather systems and alter rainfall levels, leading to urban flooding from surface water runoff.

Risks to health from environmental hazards in urban areas are increasing, due to the effects of climate change, increasing urbanization and ageing (more vulnerable) populations in most parts of the world. In 2010, more people across the world were classed as living in urban areas than rural areas for the first time. The UK is particularly urbanized; according to the 2011 census, 85% of people are classed as living in urban areas. The 2017 UK Government's Climate Change Risk Assessment highlights the need for more research into the health impacts of climate change, particulary for heat, and acknowledged the increased risks to health for urban populations. Climate change will exacerbate the effects of heat on health, through increases in mean temperature and more frequent and intense heatwaves. It is also likely to modify rainfall patterns, and alter concentrations of air pollutants such as ozone and PM, all of which will affect health.

Policies relating to climate change mitigation or adaptation require robust scientific evidence of the potential range of health impacts from multiple factors before implementation. Planned 'environmental change' in the form of interventions such as urban greening and building adaptation measures are designed to reduce future climate change as well as to adapt to the consequences of it. However, urban or building level interventions may also result in unintended negative health impacts such as increased air pollution, and these should be fully understood before measures are widely adopted.

Relating environmental factors to population exposure requires a multi-disciplinary approach using a combination of epidemiological analysis, exposure assessment and chemistry or climate modelling. This process can be challenging, and a number of limitations may affect each stage of the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) process, including a lack of observational data, or insufficient representation of urban areas in modelling studies to assess temperature or air pollution exposure. The work proposed here will improve the representation of urban areas within regional meteorological and chemistry-climate models; investigate health impacts relating to the UHI and the impacts of the UHI on indoor temperature (where people spend the majority of their time) and the potential costs and benefits to health from a range of urban planning interventions.

Quantifying existing health impacts in urban environments as well as the additional risks relating to climate change and planned environmental change will strengthen the evidence base for health impacts in the urban environment, help to inform public health, air pollution and urban planning policies, and will ultimately lead to an increase in the health of the population.",,,,,,,,,,Health,Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),,,Worktribe ,

A recent study for the Greater London Authority identified waste heat as a potentially substantial source of low grade heat, if it could be harnessed and re-purposed. Some of this waste heat is generated in the subterranean built environment of the city, which is extensive. Although the built environment below ground is quite widespread – think of the London Underground network of tunnels – the points at which heat can be extracted have the effect of condensing the heat into a limited number of outlets.

The LUSTER project – London Urban Sub-Terrain Energy Recovery – is using the 3DStock model developed by UCL Energy Insitute to map the locations of these subterranean waste heat extraction points. An analytical package is being designed to run on 3DStock, which will estimate heat demand in local buildings and then match this to the potential source(s) of waste heat. Linking the source heat point to demand is being achieved through the mapping of a ‘virtual heat network’, which can be optimised according to demand characteristics and route prioritisation, to allow cost effective use of energy that would otherwise be wasted.

The LUSTER project is a collaboration with the lead partner London South Bank University (LSBU). Led by Professor Graeme Maidment, the team at LSBU is dealing with the upgrading of the low grade heat from the sources, using heat pumps, to enable that heat to become a usable and useful source of heat in buildings, connected by heat networks.

With the UK government having committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it is hoped that a successful feasibility study will yield many opportunities for urban subterranean energy recovery, applicable to London and other cities or urban areas, with underground infrastructure, across the UK.",,,,,,Co-authorship with academic partner(s),,,,Technology and Computation ,Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),,,Worktribe ,

Instead, we seek to interrogate the meanings and conceptual boundaries of a term and, crucially, we aim to understand it from the perspective of the people with whom we work.
To many people, the idea of ‘nature’ may appear relatively straightforward, but anthropologists have shown that it is a socially-constructed concept. By that we mean that people in different social contexts may have widely differing ideas of what is ‘natural’ and what is not, or may not even share a concept anything similar to ‘nature’. Even in the UK, the contours of the concept of nature are often blurred. For example, is a family pet part of nature? To what extent is a farm, full of plants and animals yet managed by humans, a ‘natural’ environment? What about a street tree in central London?

In its aftermath, local leaders and corporate developers devised an aggressive redevelopment agenda that would have demolished the homes, workspaces and communities of thousands of council tenants, private renters and traders. Their plan was to transform Tottenham and surrounding areas from a diverse working-class place to a space for wealthy investors, residents and consumers.

Disrupting the Speculative City tells the story of how a community coalition defeated one of the most ambitious programmes of state-led gentrification in London. Known as the ‘Haringey Development Vehicle’ (HDV), it would have been executed through an undemocratic and speculative joint venture between the local council and the notorious international developer Lendlease. Thanks to the political creativity, tactical nous and extraordinary commitment of ordinary people, the HDV was scrapped by the local council in 2018.

Research at CASA into Internet based urban planning techniques has resulted in techniques whereby the common CAD based models of urban form can be adapted into a networked collaborative design and information system.

One approach to thinking about trend-breaking futures is to use visioning and backcasting as a form of scenario building. This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60% reduction target in CO2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting policy packages that are in turn assembled into clusters of policy packages to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the policy packages are used to a ‘high’ level of application. When international aviation is included and the expected growth in travel over the next 20 years, the impossibility of target achievement is clearly demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

We begin by sketching how employment models based on input–output and multiplier relationships are used to predict future employment aggregates by type and then we illustrate how these aggregates are distributed to small zones of an urban region in ways that make them consistent with the distribution of population and service employment allocated using spatial interaction-allocation models. In essence, the structure we are developing, which is part of an integrated assessment of resilience to extreme events, links input–output analysis to the allocation of employment and population using traditional land use transportation interaction models. The framework then down scales these activities which are allocated to small zones to the physical level of the city using GIS-related models functioning at an even finer spatial scale. The crucial link in this chain is how we distribute detailed employment types generated from the input–output model to small zones consistent with the way population and services are allocated using the LUTI model. To achieve this, we introduce an explicit employment forecasting model in which employment types are related to functions of floorspace that they use. These are estimated using linear regression analysis which enables future predictions of their location to be scaled in proportion to the totals generated from the input–output framework. These future estimates of floorspace condition the supply side of the model, and combined with accessibility indicators, provide the heart of the employment location model. We have developed this model for London and its region – south east England – and after presenting the results of the model, we sketch how the integrated framework is being used to generate scenarios for future employment and population change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

This work challenged earlier predictions (Toffler, 1980) that questioned the importance of space in economic, social, and work relationships in face of technological and economic transformations. Second, changes in cultural and local economic policy, which became increasingly intertwined and brought culture “to the centre of policy- making as a potential economic resource” (O’Connor, 2010, 31). Policies initially focused on flagship cultural projects and city marketing and later developed into strategies aiming at fostering creative cities or clusters. Scholarship and policy on these issues, however, stem from distinct conceptual and empirical bases (Landry and Bianchini, 1995; Florida, 2002; 2005; Pratt, 2011) suggesting that ‘the nature of the relationship between the creative economy and the city, in real or aspirational governance terms, is far from settled’ (Pratt and Hutton, 2013, 92).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Along with urban climate factors, a number of behavioral factors are further contributing to a significant rise in cooling demand across the EU including countries with a more moderate climate, such as the UK. This chapter investigates environmental and behavioral factors affecting residential air conditioning use in two large EU cities with different climates – Athens and London. This scoping study analyses carbon and health implications of increasing cooling demand, and identifies important physical attributes and occupants’ behavioral patterns that affect air conditioning use, as well as, typical operational temperatures and schedules. The high satisfaction with domestic air conditioning units highlighted in both studies suggests that in the foreseeable future with changing climate the UK may experience a similar increase in market penetration of domestic air conditioning as has occurred in Greece over the last 20 years. This might have a major impact on the summer electricity load and domestic sector carbon emissions in the UK, which already accounts for almost 30% of the UK building stock emission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Thrift, a proponent of non-representational theory conceptualises space as an emergent property of practice that occurs prior to conscious definitions. Hence, space is a site of open-ended possibilities, a non-discursive affordance to life in a given locale. Conversely, place is a more conscious and meaningful construction that people use to understand the space they live in. Although it is a complex construction in its own right, ‘a constellation of processes rather than a thing’ (Massey 2005, 141), place is distinguished by including social narratives and meanings. The concept of place, therefore, extends beyond non-reflexive practices and material flows, incorporating instead purposeful social action in the form of political activities, values, norms, memories, stories and histories. This interplay between spatial materialities, socialities and culture, which transforms a generic space into a culturally charged place, is conventionally known as place-making. Place-making activities occur when we make efforts to define, understand, experience, navigate, utilise, modify or regulate what is happening in and with space. Therefore, place-making activities bridge between space and place. They draw on the mundane practices that serve to extend or maintain local social networks through face-to-face interaction, in addition to more purposive efforts to build a sense of place and belonging. Place-making then, is about the production of locality:  the set of processes that communities used to build a sense of place out of space (Appadurai 1996; Feld and Baso 1996). It involves turning a seemingly generic, ambiguous, unruly or ‘fuzzy’ site of spatial possibility into a more meaningful and social entity, where we recognise ourselves in relation to others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

The project investigated five present-day temporary projects sited on vacant land in London. Conscious of the long history of creative temporary occupations, the project pushes against the ephemeral nature of interim projects of the past, strategically documenting the five case studies through interviews, film, site surveys and photographs.
The specific purpose of this paper is to contextualise this recent fieldwork against the wider historical background of the creative temporary uses of vacant urban space, therefore negotiating between definitions of ‘vacant’ and ‘empty’. Vacant spaces have been historically associated with dereliction or abandonment, ‘lost space’ (Trancik 1986), ‘urban voids’ and ‘cracks in the city’ (Loukaitou-Sideris 1996). Against the perception of vacancy as waste and emptiness, a more positive reading has been promoted through the notion of the ‘terrain vague’ (de Sola-Morales 1995).
Although the present-day case studies emerged out of a very particular political, economic and cultural context, that of the late-2000s recession, this is not the first time that temporary uses have emerged in the history of London. Some of the case studies of the research project are located on sites with legacies of use that stretch back far beyond the 20th century and such histories complicate our readings of these short-term projects. The paper is however primarily concerned with the post-war context of London, up to the present day. Using the case studies as a spur for reflection, it provides an overview of the key moments in the evolution of creative temporary projects developed in vacant spaces. The discussion
also highlights links between past and present projects. Setting out from the post-war reconstruction years, the paper explores the 1960s countercultural projects as well as the 1970s post-countercultural community garden movement and the urban ecology turn. It then considers the impact of an increasingly global environmental awareness in the 1980s, leading up to the 1990s regeneration boom. This broad survey is supported by specific historical examples of creative use - some of which have proved to be truly temporary whilst
others have managed to endure - explored through published material, interviews with initiators and archival photographic records.
Through this historical review the paper links London projects to wider movements worldwide, with particular references to US and Europe where a direct influence can be established. Key themes emerging that provide insights into practices and ideologies relating to ‘emptiness’ are discussed and their legacies for contemporary urban projects identified. The paper observes that there has been a historical evolution in how ‘empty space’ has been discovered, made visible and reimagined in 20th century London, and highlights its relevance for today’s vacant urban spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Much of the critical literature on neoliberal urban development and many of the policy frameworks that shape planning systems characterise the real estate and investment sectors in a relatively simplified way. They are often presented, implicitly or explicitly, as a unified interest with a clear subjectivity built around: 'fast' returns from investment decisions; a lack of consideration for broader public interests; outlooks dominated by the conversion of places into profit maximising investment spaces; and counter-productive approaches towards citizens and government authorities who potentially seek to disrupt their programmes and projects. Such characterisations are becoming increasingly important as regulators in major cities such as London and Toronto are calling for the introduction of new policy technologies and techniques to try and exert greater territorial control over increasingly fluid investment flows, real estate actors and other institutions within cities. Through this chapter we will challenge these preconceived notions relating to real estate actor behaviour and demonstrate their more nuanced, integrated and essential role within London's politics of planning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

In this chapter, I first interrogate these arguments, using qualitative evidence, before turning to the case study of a still-unfolding major infrastructure-led redevelopment, Crossrail, around Tottenham Court Road Station in central London, to highlight the more profound ways that LGBTQ+ venues are networked into processes of urbanization. In this case, in 2006, we see the first attempt by City Hall to name a threat to a venue specifically because of its negative impact on a protected minority, defined under the category of ‘sexual orientation’. We also witness the first uses, in London, of online campaigns to express community objection to the potential loss of venues. A formal equalities impact assessment process highlighted the threat to one of the capital’s biggest and most stridently commercial gay club nights, aligned as it was with international business and property interests. Smaller-scale venues in the vicinity, including those proactively inclusive of more marginalized LGBTQ+ people, were overlooked and closed. Often opportunistically located in precarious sites and buildings during temporary breaks in redevelopment cycles, LGBTQ+ venues of all models are vulnerable once those cycles accelerate. Under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, following a crisis of closures in 2015, and after a period of extensive activism to protect and reopen queer spaces, licensed LGBTQ+ venues have now been categorized as ‘social and cultural infrastructure’ in policy discussions. I frame this designation by turning to earlier empirical studies of lesbian and gay populations’ networks from the late 1960s, and to debates about relationality in queer theory of the 2000s. I propose that thinking of today’s LGBTQ+ venues as queer infrastructure encapsulates the profile of dispersed, interconnected, heterogeneous LGBTQ+ communities in London, and the ways these attach to, traverse, and disrupt international lines of property, heritage, and identity in processes of social and cultural reproduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

London and horror cinema, focusing on Death Line (1972) and Creep (2004). Films
that employ the underground, particularly spaces of travel such as the London
Underground, create a distinct geographical world where the perception of space
seems to be replaced by a heightened awareness of time (the Tube journey). Yet, this
absence of space paradoxically makes the Underground more immanent – an
imaginative space shot through with narrative potential. Indeed, the films I explore
also turn the banal experience of the Underground – that of everyday travel – into a
more complex one, in which the spaces of the Victorian underground return as spaces
of horror. The mapping of those spaces reveals how the imagined city relates to its
physical counterpart, and how the present city relates to its Victorian forebear, tracing
a rich spatial experience of the underground that is usually absent in the contemporary
workaday city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Ontologies, as branch of AI, are helpful to set the domain for a clear, simple and user-friendly representation of concepts and their relationships. Incubators has developed the Taxonomy of Interventions based on the experience in three ‘living labs’ in Brussels, London and Turin. Each living lab had the opportunity to unfold its own particular and context-based configuration that can best support the local self-organisation of places.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Evidence from past heatwave periods indicates that London’s Urban Heat Island effect contributes substantially to heat-related mortality rates. During a warm period in 2006, the proportion of heat deaths attributable to this effect was estimated to be 37.7% in outer London, 46.6% in inner London and 47.2% in central London, compared to a reference rural location. The relative effect of the heat island needs to be also examined in conjunction with the influence of individual building geometry, fabric and system characteristics. Epidemiological analyses of London mortality records have demonstrated that the spatial variation of heat-related mortality in London reflects background mortality rates related to population age. As such, higher levels of excess heat-related mortality occur in areas towards the outskirts of London with larger proportions of older residents. Housing features, however, cause a larger variation in temperature exposure and associated risks than the heat island intensity alone. This chapter briefly discusses a series of London urban heat health assessment methods and decision-making support tools.KeywordsLondonUrban environmentCitiesHeatOverheatingUrban temperatureUrban warmingUrban climateUrban heat islandClimate changeThermal comfortHealthWellbeingHeat-related mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Then, in 2002, the UK government introduced a new progressive beer duty tax which enabled small-scale brewers to brew beer while paying less tax than their larger competitors, thus levelling the uneven financial playing field that economies of scale had created. This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made.

It is based on findings of research being undertaken by the research project VivaCity 2020, funded by EPSRC (Sustainable Urban Environment Programme). In literature, diversity especially land use diversity has a positive relationship with what is considered a “well-working” urban area. However lived experience suggests that there are no precise description of a “successful” urban environment but it is one of those phenomena that “you know when you see it”. The paper deals with the notion of differentiation and choice that diversity implies, and the concepts of legibility and intelligibility, introduced by Lynch and Hillier respectively, to retrieve identities and structures from the physical environment that surrounds us. Through an analysis of correlation of spatial and occupational patterns, based on space syntax methodology, Clerkenwell is found to be a fragmented but structured system of different centers of activity developed around locally strategic streets. This paper argues that one part of its success lies in exactly the maintenance of a relatively complex and difficult to understand whole composed of relatively easy to understand parts. This may account for the longevity and diversity of local economy and urban fabric. Perhaps this can become a model for urban planners and decisions makers in seeking to reproduce the vibrancy of the 19th century European city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

As a result, flooding is expected to occur more frequently in London. Flood simulation modelling has previously been done to predict the impact on the built environment for a variety of scenarios for London. However, such models have not taken into account the detailed hygric behaviour of the building stock under flooding and drying conditions which can vary significantly between property types, and can lead to prolonged damp and health problems. To address this problem, a building stock model of central London has been developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), with information on the age, structure, and height of each dwelling and assumptions about built form based on historical building standards and surveys. This paper describes a novel methodology for the development of a building stock model with the necessary information to carry out hygrothermal simulations of the penetration of water into the building envelopes of flooded homes and the subsequent drying under different environmental scenarios. It discusses how the risk of damp in flooded homes can be modelled using hygrothermal methods and supplemented with mould models. By combining the multidisciplinary components of GIS, building simulation, and microbiological modelling, a holistic picture of the potential health implications of flooding at a population level across different temporal and spatial scales can be developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

consideration in the influence of urban morphological properties. In “pricing accessibility”, Webster

built environment morphology is through its spatial configuration. (Hillier and Hanson 1984) He
argues this understanding can potentially lead to more efficient allocation of resources. This research
thus makes use of the hedonic approach, an established methodology in environmental economics, in
estimating the influence of spatial configuration on observed housing sold price. (Rosen 1974) The
results from this study suggest that spatial configuration measure of accessibility such as space
syntax integration and space syntax choice are significant variables influencing transaction house

We investigated the spatial variation in heat-related mortality risks across London due to population age, urban heat island (UHI) and building characteristics. Methods Dynamic building physics models were run for 126 different age and built form variants of buildings statistically representative of the London housing stock, outputting average maximum daily internal temperatures for a hot summer period in 2006. Internal and modelled UHI temperature estimates for the same period in London were mapped to individual dwellings in Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and deviations of building-specific indoor and outdoor temperatures from the London-average were calculated and summarised at ward level. Office of National Statistics age-specific absolute mortality data and the above-calculated UHI and indoor temperature anomalies were then used to estimate spatial variation in mortality according to an age-specific relative risk function for heat in London. Results There was appreciable variation in indoor temperatures under the modelled climate, with a mean maximum range of 2.5°C. Modelled results indicate that the largest mortality risks may lie in outer London, as the elderly population is larger there than in Central London. Top-floor flats in multiple occupancy buildings and bungalows were found to be the most at-risk dwelling types. Limitations in building stock information and occupancy scenario assumptions mean that some buildings may be worse than modelled. Conclusions These results indicate that UHI and indoor temperatures may cause an appreciable spatial variation in the risks from heat-related mortality, but that the driving factor remains population age. Further work is required to explore the risks for individuals living in extreme heat-poor housing conditions or for those unable to take action to cool the indoor environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

 housing crisis in London. An overwhelming majority of the city’s population face the
 predicament of deteriorating housing affordability. Median house prices are now more than ten
 times median incomes, additions to the stock are insufficient, and prices are volatile.
 In the search for remedies, well-intended solutions emerging from fragmented analyses of the
 problem inevitably lead to unintended consequences. The incapacity of the human mind to
 correctly infer the behaviour of complex systems presents a case for System Dynamics.
 This paper, the result of the first year of a PhD, describes the underlying socio-economic
 structure responsible for the Housing crisis in London. We have built a causal loop diagram of
 London’s housing situation which demonstrates how the interlocking of numerous reinforcing
 feedback loops have contributed to the house price inflation, and how the potential for a future
 crash is essentially built into the system. We contend that this type of conceptualisation can
 help prevent the typical ‘blame game’ going on in various circles, and focus resources on
 overhauling the broken system via designing and implementing a concerted package of
 transformative policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

The fast pace of technology development is considered an enabler for agile working. However, there are very few studies done on analysing the interconnected relationship between the social and technical/technological aspects of agile working.
This case study was undertaken on three floors of the headquarter building of a construction and property development company in Central London. The study involved introducing agile working concept in the workplace, including adding social spaces, flexible open plan workstations monitored by Internet of things (IoT) technology i.e. occupancy sensors, implementing a new system of monitoring and managing meeting spaces to maximise the efficiency of space utilisation, and introducing a new Information technology and cybersecurity strategy to allow for this change. The study will analyse the factors that influenced this workplace change such as limitations of space, technology development, and the need for maximising the efficiency of the workplace.

A façade retrofit presented a challenge for resolving potentially conflicting comfort considerations, e.g. large views and glare, with simple installations such as vertical fins. This study identified critical comfort issues and generated an optimized façade design with occupancy survey and multi-objective optimization. Sunlight glare, temperature and stability in winter and summer, and noise from colleagues were identified as key comfort factors, and then parameterized with building simulation programs as optimization objectives. A simple façade design was developed with parametric controls on glazing ratio, shading device, and glazing types. The optimal solution was found to be fully opaque insulation on South and West façades, extensive glazing on the North and East façades, and secondary glazing in all façades. Improvements in the heating system and building envelope was found essential for further thermal comfort improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

 detailed data on every separate domestic and non-domestic building in Greater London. It includes threedimensional information about buildings including their heights, volumes, wall areas, floor areas and the
 distribution of activities between different floors. These data are drawn from University College London Energy
 Institute’s existing 3DStock model of London. Within the model information is attached on the ages of
 buildings, their materials of construction, and (in some cases) their servicing systems. Energy Performance
 Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) are also attached to premises and dwellings along
 with gas and electricity energy consumption.
 Buildings in London are responsible for over 65% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributed
 to the Greater London region in 2016. Reducing CO2 emissions that can be attributed to buildings is the key
 focus of this work in line with the GLA’s ambition to dramatically reduce these overall CO2 emissions; aiming to
 make London a zero-carbon city by 2050.
 Improving the energy performance of existing buildings has to be a key strategy if the overall CO2
 emissions are to be reduced. Knowing the characteristics and current energy efficiency of the building stock is
 the first step towards reducing direct and indirect CO2 emissions from these buildings. Collecting the data is
 one challenge, but making sense of these huge quantities of data is a bigger challenge. Structuring the data can
 help here and so for this paper we present the evaluation of energy efficiency of buildings in London using
 urban density to aggregate the data. Energy efficiency is measured from both EPCs and energy consumption.
 Some of the existing measures that might influence current energy efficiency are then shown at different levels
 of urban density. Finally, in order to address the improvement of the energy efficiency we quantify the
 ‘potential’ improvements of these buildings (according to the EPC recommendations) and hence the suitability
 of different retrofit solutions, again aggregated by urban density. The results show that energy use intensity
 decreases as urban density increases; that urban density has some influence on existing efficiency measures
 and finally that most of the measures of retrofit potential change with increasing urban density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

Reducing energy demand by implementing rapid energy saving measures has been effective in mitigating many electricity shortages globally to date. This thesis investigates whether similar measures could be effective in the UK in the event of a natural gas shortage, using a case study of London’s households. A mail survey was developed and sent to a sample of 1,600 households in London to investigate which energy saving actions respondents would implement in a gas shortage. The questionnaire suggested a hypothetical scenario, where the media and government asked households to save energy for one month and also included questions about the respondents, their households and their dwellings. The resulting energy savings were subsequently calculated for each household using ‘MESAH’, a computer model developed during this research. This model used energy saving estimates based on a review of literature about household activities that use energy. Using these assumptions, the savings achieved by the different households varied vastly, reaching an overall total of approximately 30% of normal gas and electricity use in January. This result was relatively stable during the winter season. It was however found to be very sensitive to assumptions taken about the energy savings, and whether the respondents implemented actions as stated in the survey. It also found that the different actions proposed had very disparate saving impacts. The savings calculated represent high estimates of energy saving potential, rather than predictions due to uncertainties and limitations in the research. The project identified rapid energy savings as an option for an emergency response, but stressed that this approach should only be taken in extreme situations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

This study examined the potential unequal distribution of public transport accessibility with a focus on demographic groups defined by ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status over the past decade, at the LSOA level in the Greater London Area. After accounting for geographical features, car ownership, population density, and spatial autocorrelation in spatial lag models, the disparities for ethnicity were found, as the mixed and other ethnic groups were more disadvantaged both in 2011 and 2021, while the Asian ethnic groups had a more advantaged position. Income also played a role, as wealthier groups tended to have better access to public transport; however, these privileges decreased throughout the decade. The accessibility advantage of the middle-aged and older groups in 2011 diminished significantly by 2021. This was replaced by the median low-level age group, which had the most prominent advantage in tube accessibility.

Since the hygrothermal properties of the existing building materials can influence the moisture balance of the wall considerably, identifying the wall type and understanding its hygrothermal properties is extremely important in building retrofit. The objective of this study is to explore the variability of the hygrothermal properties of different bricks from one wall located in London.

Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants, Cambridge, UK",Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"The urban heat island (UHI) is a well-known effect of urbanisation and is particularly important in world megacities. Overheating in such cities is expected to be exacerbated in the future as a result of further urban growth and climate change. Demonstrating and quantifying the impact of individual design interventions on the UHI is currently difficult using available software tools. The tools developed in the LUCID ('The Development of a Local Urban Climate Model and its Application to the Intelligent Design of Cities') research project will enable the related impacts to be better understood, quantified and addressed. This article summarises the relevant literature and reports on the ongoing work of the project.Practical applications: There is a complex relationship between built form, urban processes, local temperature, comfort, energy use and health. The UHI effect is significant and there is a growing recognition of this issue. Developers and planners are seeking advice on design decisions at a variety of scales based on scientifically robust, quantitative methods. The LUCID project has thus developed a series of tools that (1) quantify the effect of urbanisation processes on local environmental conditions, and (2) quantify the impact of such conditions on comfort, energy use and health. The use of such tools is vital, both to inform policy but also to be able to demonstrate compliance with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Until relatively recently these models have been developed in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software more often then in GIS. One of the main reasons was that ‘3-D GIS’ was often only 2.5-D under closer inspection. This is changing, and by straddling both technologies, and integrating others, we show how these models in turn enable planning information, statistics, pollution levels, sea level rises and much more to be visualised and analysed in the context of the 3-D city model. The client for ‘Virtual London’ is the Greater London Authority (GLA) and their aim is to develop improved dissemination of planning information, which is explored. We then argue that virtual cities should go well beyond the traditional conceptions of 3-D GIS and CAD into virtual worlds and online design. But we also urge caution in pushing the digital message too far, showing how more conventional tangible media is always necessary in rooting such models in more realistic and familiar representations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Simulations are performed with the urban surfaces represented and with the urban surfaces replaced with grass in order to calculate the urban increment on the local meteorology. The local urban effects were moderated to some extent by the passage of an onshore flow that propagated up the Thames estuary and across the city, cooling London slightly in the afternoon. Validations of screen-level temperature show encouraging agreement to within 1–2 K, when the urban increment is up to 5 K. The model results are then used to examine factors shaping the spatial and temporal structure of London's atmospheric boundary layer. The simulations reconcile the differences in the temporal evolution of the urban heat island (UHI) shown in various studies and demonstrate that the variation of UHI with time depends strongly on the urban fetch. The UHI at a location downwind of the city centre shows a decrease in UHI during the night, while the UHI at the city centre stays constant. Finally, the UHI at a location upwind of the city centre increases continuously. The magnitude of the UHI by the time of the evening transition increases with urban fetch. The urban increments are largest at night, when the boundary layer is shallow. The boundary layer experiences continued warming after sunset, as the heat from the urban fabric is released, and a weakly convective boundary layer develops across the city. The urban land-use fraction is the dominant control on the spatial structure in the sensible heat flux and the resulting urban increment, although even the weak advection present in this case study is sufficient to advect the peak temperature increments downwind of the most built-up areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

which contributes least to CO2 emission reduction targets. This paper reports on the findings of the
VIBAT London study (www.vibat.org) which considers the role of the transport sector in reducing CO2
emissions in London.

The analysis develops a transport and carbon simulation model (TC-SIM) for London. Within this,
users are able to consider the implementation of a series of potential policy packages—low emission
vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimes, public transport, walking and cycling, strategic and local
urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and
slower speeds, long distance travel substitution, freight transport and international air. They can select
variable levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emission reduction targets. The roles of
carbon rationing and oil prices are also considered. TC-SIM can be played in different user modes: as
‘free riders’, ‘techno-optimists’, ‘enviro-optimists’, ‘complacent car addicts’ and other typical travel
market segments, including a ‘free role’. Game playing or scenario testing such as this helps to highlight
perceived levels of homogeneity of views within certain cohorts, the development of entrenched
positions and the likely success in achieving objectives.

The paper develops various policy packages, scenarios and pathways aimed at reducing transport
CO2 emissions. It argues that strategic CO2 emission reduction targets are very ambitious relative to
current progress, and that we need to act more effectively across a wide range of policy mechanisms,
with a ‘high intensity application’ of many of the options, to get near to achieving these targets. A
critical issue here will be in communicating and gaining greater ‘ownership’ of future lifestyle choices
with stakeholders and the public, and participation tools such as TC-SIM could become increasingly
important in this area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The paper presents a critique of the UK approach to energy and transport, commenting on the limited approach and measures used, and their effectiveness. The necessary policy measures are available, but at present there is not sufficient political and public support for wide-ranging, effective action. Technology on its own will not be enough. This message is then reinforced with a more local perspective in London where considerable efforts are being made to make London a sustainable city, but even here where opportunities are present, it is the growth in travel and in particular in aviation, that makes transport-based targets very difficult to achieve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

A backcasting study approach was used, and the likely impacts of alternative images of 2025 were tested. A transportation and carbon simulation game was also developed for London. Within this game, users are able to consider a series of potential policy packages, such as low-emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimens, public transportation, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long-distance travel substitution, freight transportation, and international air, and select various levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emissions reduction targets. The roles of two external enabling measures, carbon rationing and oil pricing, were also considered. The paper considers an optimized policy package for 2025. A deep reduction in CO2 emissions from the transportation sector is theoretically possible, yet difficult to achieve. The main perceived problem is in engendering an interest in the public to change consumer purchases and behaviors.

Governing a world city like London has always been a difficult process. Legislative commitments to address London's sustainable future have sometimes been undermined by different policy interpretations by different key players over different time periods. This has created a fluid and diverse structure of governance that enables short-term policy shifts but which threatens longer term strategic sustainability policy commitments. These interpretations have occurred against an ongoing and contentious political debate over powers and responsibilities between different scales of the state, and the rights to make key decisions affecting London's future. This has resulted in a policy and governmental structure that is highly dependent on negotiation and compromise and one that employs a variety of policy tools, information and persuasion, financial incentives, and collaboration, to achieve a balanced form of governance.

The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies.

Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions.

The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a ‘strategic conversation’ at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It is in this context that the concept of resilience planning has taken on a new significance. Drawing on contemporary research in London and Hong Kong, the paper shows how resilience and recovery planning has become a key area of political debate. It examines what is meant by conservative and radical interpretations of resilience and how conservative views have come to dominate ‘recovery’ thinking, with élite groups unwilling to accept the limits to the neo-liberal orthodoxies that helped to precipitate the economic crisis.

Projected higher temperatures due to a change in climate would further exacerbate the effects of London's UHI. It is therefore necessary to understand its net impact and adopt strategies to cope with and mitigate its negative aspects. The Lucid project is addressing both these issues and this paper focuses on the second component. There is currently a lack of practical assessment instruments available to planners, designers and developers that can assess a development's impact on the UHI. This paper thus presents a proposal for a multi-scaled UHI assessment tool framework that could be used in developing relevant planning policy and assessing UHI mitigation design strategies.

The gates erected by the Romans on the most important routes in and out of the city were rebuilt on their ancient foundations in the medieval period, when posterns (smaller passageways) were added in the wall and a huge ditch was dug around the outside. By the seventeenth century, there were seven principal gates in the old wall: from east to west starting from the Tower, they were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate and Ludgate. On the bridge across the River Thames – the only point of entry to the City from the south – there were two more gates. The ditch, as John Stow recorded in his Survey of London (first published in 1598), was ‘of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon’. This treatment of the ditch points to how the urban fabric had long since pushed through the gates and beyond the old walls; this area ‘without’, but still under the City’s jurisdiction, was known as the Liberties. In Hollar’s map of London in the later seventeenth century (Fig. 1), the walls and gates are a clearly visible feature defining the core of the City, which none the less spreads beyond them, in particular to the west. The limits of the Liberties were marked on main roads by ‘bars’, usually consisting of posts and chains, as at Holborn (to the north) or Whitechapel (to the east). Temple Bar, however, situated on Fleet Street to the west of Ludgate, had been made a gateway by the mid-fourteenth century, a reflection of its importance as the main point of transition between the Cities of London and Westminster. As such Temple Bar was considered one of the City gates; it was the eighth gate in the engraved plate that accompanied John Strype’s version of Stow’s Survey, published in 1720.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The annual primary energy demand was 125kWh/m2, marginally above the 120 kWh/m2 target. The measured internal heat gains of 3.65 W/m2 are much greater than the 2.1 W/m2 suggested as standard for dwellings. The Passive House Planning Package, PHPP, is found to be a good predictor of space heating demand and the risk of summer time over heating. Winter space heating demand is sensitive to occupant blind use.

The dual representation of a planar graph is a content-based network, where each node is a set of edges of the planar graph and represents a transportation unit in the so-called information space, i.e., the space where information is handled in order to navigate through the city. First, we discuss a novel hybrid technique to extract dual graphs from planar graphs, called the hierarchical intersection continuity negotiation principle. Then we show that the growth of the network can be analytically described by logistic laws and that the topological properties of the network are governed by robust log-normal distributions characterizing the network's connectivity and small-world properties that are consistent over time. Moreover, we find that the double-Pareto-like distributions for the connectivity emerge for major roads and can be modeled via a stochastic content-based network model using simple space-filling principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Driven by the European Union's 20-20- 20 strategy, Governments throughout Europe have implemented policies to support renewable generation and energy efficiency. In the UK, a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme was launched in 2010 and has been so successful in creating growth in the PV market that tariff digression has had to be accelerated. A loan scheme, the Green Deal, which provides up front capital for energy efficiency measures was launched in 2012.

Despite the success of the FiT scheme, the penetration of PV in London has lagged behind other areas. In this paper we examine the reasons for this by taking Berlin and the German policy of Feed-in Tariffs and soft-loans as a comparator and modeling the effect of tariff rates and loan availability on uptake in London to understand the impact the Green Deal might have on the UK PV market. Further, we address another important consideration for policy, namely, shortcomings in the field performance of PV systems through the comparison of theoretical and measured performance. It is concluded that soft-loans would have a limited impact on market growth when compared with the effect of providing increased FiT rates to social landlords.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Four classrooms in these contemporary schools also failed to keep average indoor CO2 levels below 1500 ppm in the non-heating season. During the heating season, eight classrooms exceeded the daily average indoor CO2 levels.

Identification of specific volatile organic compounds indicated the presence of strong indoor sources including furniture, cleaning products, and teaching materials.

The effectiveness of green and cool roofs at reducing summertime overheating was assessed for a naturally ventilated, poorly insulated office roof in London. This was contrasted to the application of retrofitting traditional insulation. The new Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers overheating criteria was used to assess the level of overheating as predicted by a whole building thermal simulation model. The impacts of the roofing strategies were split into the direct and indirect effects. The indirect effects of the roofs were modelled using microclimatic modelling software. The results indicate the direct effects of green and cool roofs at reducing overheating are much greater than the indirect cooling effect. A non-insulated cool roof was found to be the most effective strategy. By insulating the roof, the level of overheating was slightly reduced. Non-insulated green and cool roofs were more effective than insulated roofs at reducing levels of overheating. When using a 2050 weather file, the building frequently overheated without the use of green or cool roof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

These technologies were compared to application of retrofitting traditional insulation. Initial microclimatic modelling of the impact of the roofs showed that both green and cool roofs can reduce air temperatures directly above their surfaces, with maximum air temperature reductions of 1 °C. The results of the microclimatic modelling were then used as input into a whole building thermal simulation model, in order to assess the direct and indirect effects of the roofs. The building modelling results indicate that in the current climate, green roofs reduce annual energy use within the building. The level of savings are reduced when green roofs are dry in the summer. Cool roofs are more effective in the summer, but result in an annual energy penalty due to their performance in winter. In a 2050 climate scenario, both green and cool roofs result in a reduction in annual energy use. The application of traditional insulation is the most effective technology at reducing annual energy use. Adding insulation and a green or cool roof reduces the relative effectiveness of the roofs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It assesses the impacts and outcomes of so-called new localist reforms and argues that we are witnessing two principal trends. First, governance processes are increasingly dominated by anti-democratic development machines, characterized by new assemblages of public- and private-sector experts. These machines reflect and reproduce a type of development politics in which there is a greater emphasis on a pragmatic realism and a politics of delivery. Second, the presence of these machines is having a significant impact on the politics of planning. Democratic engagement is not seen as the basis for new forms of localism and community control. Instead, it is presented as a potentially disruptive force that needs to be managed by a new breed of skilled private-sector consultant. The paper examines these wider shifts in urban politics before focusing on the connections between emerging development machines and local residential and business communities.

It is offered with a view to help better identify the distribution of the projects costs and benefits and shed greater light on the possible ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ over space and time, and under given scenarios.
Drawing from an extensive array of public domain literature the paper sets out both the policy and planning contexts for the project plus the business case that led to a decision by UK Treasury to guar- antee a £1 billion loan to Transport for London for the construction of the Northern Line's extension. The paper looks at the scale and nature of the megaproject's features, particularly its line-haul and related real estate developments, especially those in the assigned development opportunity area. The text presents the policy, planning, legislative and regulative dimensions of the project likely to define its revenue generation prospects and environmental and social impacts, with special attention paid to those project outcomes affecting key stakeholders over time and space. The paper also seeks to explain the mechanics of how to employ a policy-led multi-criteria framework together with its associated processes within which stakeholder policies and agendas can be mapped and common/divergent interests iden- tified. This is done with a view to ultimately facilitate stakeholder negotiation decision-making trade-offs in given scenarios under the policy guidance of the Greater London Authority with the support of the Treasury of the UK Government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Here we outline work we have been doing using a remarkable big data set for public transport in Greater London generated from the smart card data called the Oyster Card which has been in use for over 13 years. We explore the generic properties of the Tube and Overground rail system focussing first on the scale and distribution of the flow volumes at stations, then engaging in an analysis of temporal flows that can be decomposed into various patterns using principal components analysis (PCA which smooth out normal fluctuations and leave a residual in which significant deviations can be tracked and explained. We then explore the heterogeneity in the data set with respect to how travel behaviour varies over different time intervals and suggest how we can use these ideas to detect and manage disruptions on the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

As budget cuts continue to affect local government in England, this paper concludes that although small experiments in participatory gov- ernance may persist, the dominant mode of governance is likely to shift towards more hierarchical and coercive forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Hitchcock T",,,Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis,"Using a substantial set of vagrancy removal records for Middlesex (1777–86) giving details of the place of origin of some 11,500 individuals, and analysing these records using a five-variable gravity model of migration, this article addresses a simple question: from which parts of England did London draw its lower-class migrants in the late eighteenth century? It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants—contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Using a case study of urban regeneration within the Thames Gateway area of London, the paper examines the locus of power in the relationships between central and local government and the key economic interests; this allows a reappraisal of the claims of the local authority to be enabling development. The paper then turns to the language of enabling as found in policy and academic literature and argues both that changes in the language of policy have been distinctive and that this is actively contributing to the new urban governance. This analysis is grounded in a framework for considering the relationship of language to the policy process, proposing a rhetorical methodology of policy discourse analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Never has so much anticipation and expectation been placed on one single area-based project. It is expected to simultaneously: generate new job opportunities for hard-to-reach groups of the unemployed; bring about the regeneration of some of Europe’s most deprived neighbourhoods; lead to increases in sports participation; generate positive health outcomes; and even help to stave off recession in London by acting as a Keynesian boost in the midst of austerity (see for example The Economist (Citation2013)). For urban policy researchers the London Games thus represents a unique policy experiment; it is a location in which over £10 billion of area-based expenditure has been mobilised at the same time as local communities have faced the biggest mainstream welfare cuts in a generation. A proper assessment of local impacts in this context should shed light on broader debates over the (in)effectiveness of area-based programmes in cities and whether development in an area leads to the development of that area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

With road space in urban centers being increasingly reallocated to pavement widening, and bus and cycle lanes, there is growing interest in alternative solutions to the last-mile delivery problem. We make three contributions in this paper: firstly, through empirical analysis using carrier operational datasets, we quantify the characteristics of last-mile parcel operations and demonstrate the reliance placed on walking by vehicle drivers with their vans being parked at the curbside for on average 60% of the total vehicle round time; secondly, we introduce the concept of “portering” where vans rendezvous with porters who operate within specific geographical “patches” to service consignees on foot, potentially saving 86% in driving distance on some rounds and 69% in time; finally, we highlight the wider practical issues and optimization challenges associated with operating driving and portering rounds in inner urban areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The consensus around this belief has been almost unanimous, despite the contradiction between the idea of scarcity and that of vacancy. This paper explores the assumptions underpinning this contradiction to point to new ways of addressing the ‘vacant land problem’. Drawing on the work of Lefebvre and Massey, the paper suggests a dialectical framing of vacant land to understand how its socially constructed nature shapes its transformation. The paper reveals a static understanding of urban change behind the conceptualisation of Battersea Power Station and Silvertown Quays as ‘bad places’, which in turn legitimises and shapes their transformation.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, 5.1% of spending on groceries in 2013 was transacted online, an increase from 3.8% in 2010. (The level was 1.1% in 2003.) Transport researchers face serious gaps in empirical data coverage of this phenomenon, however, because regional and national travel surveys typically collect limited information with which to establish how in-store and online shopping relate to one another. To address this issue, the authors employed a well-established data resource in a novel approach. The UK Living Costs and Food Survey is traditionally used to track aggregate household expenditure patterns and to monitor price inflation. This study drew on the unique nature of the survey's expenditure diary, in which respondents recorded each item that they purchased during a 2-week period; respondents also recorded whether each shopping occasion was in-store or online. Empirically, it was found that shopping basket characteristics (types of products being purchased) were significantly linked with channel choice (online versus in-store). Furthermore, with a twostage modeling approach, it was found that sociodemographic factors appeared to relate in different ways to adoption of online shopping in general and to the choice of online versus in-store for individual shopping occasions. The paper closes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

In 2018, British newspaper The Times published an exposé of the international non-governmental organisation (INGO) Oxfam GB and its handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct of its staff in Haiti and the Philippines (known colloquially as the “Oxfam-Haiti scandal”). An investigation into Oxfam GB by the Charity Commission, a government body that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales, found that the organisation’s safeguarding strategy, approach and resourcing were significant areas of weakness that meant “the charity exposed itself to undue risk, amounting to mismanagement in the administration of the charity”.Footnote 1 The lever of exposure to risks – including the risk of causing harm to others alongside reputational risks – led to major sector-wide investment and the growth of teams of safeguarding professionals that introduced new or shored up existing policies, practices, lines of reporting and accountability and engendered behavioural change. By 2022, the international development and charity sector has become well versed and proactive in its management and mitigation of risks within the organisation and those caused by the organisation. These are risks that can be known, boxed into processes attentive to them and contained so that organisations may continue their substantive work. This framework and approach to understanding and managing risk as an operational exercise seems profoundly unsuited to the next great challenge facing the international development and charity sector and the development sector more widely – a challenge that aims to undo its rules and institutions and disrupt its very paradigm of knowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

In Maslow’s hierarchy, safety is one of the foundational needs of well-being. The built environment should be safe to use at all times of the day and for all groups of people. After dark, the appearance of the outdoor environment changes dramatically, and this could impact the opportunities for crime. This study investigated the impact of daylight on the rates of different types of crime by comparing the crime rates during selected periods of daylight and darkness. The study used records of crime data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By studying crimes in the week on either side of the twice-yearly clock change, it is possible to compare periods that are dark in one week and light in the other at the same clock time. Where the time at which the crime took place was known, and using the GPS coordinates of the specific crime, the solar altitude was calculated and used to determine if it was light or dark at the time of the crime. A similar calculation was used to see if the crime would have been in the dark or light in the week on the other side of the clock change. The headline result is that there was 4.8% (OR 1.07) more crime in the dark periods than the light ones. However, this increase was not uniform across all crime types, and there were some further complications in some results due to potential changes in the behavior of some victims after dark. For the crimes of theft from a person and robbery of personal property, there was a significant increase during the dark period. The availability of light had an impact on the rate of certain crimes. Whilst this does not provide any information about the impact of street lighting on crime, it does provide some idea of by how much crime could be reduced if better lighting was provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

From the visionary artist-turned-architect Constant Nieuwenhuys, to 1960's giants Archigram and SuperStudio, to deconstructivists Daniel Libeskind and Zaha Hadid and contemporary digitally inspired work by Nox and Decoi, this was the most comprehensive survey of experimental architecture to be held in the UK.

The exhibition revisits the radical, brutalist architecture and avant-garde sound and music composition of Paris during the 1960s and 70s, transferring their work to London to intersect with the sounds and surfaces of the brutalist interior of the Barbican.

The project follows on from Photolanguage’s production of a Brutalist Map of Paris for Blue Crow Media (2016), and includes imagery and recordings from buildings by Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Renaudie and Renée Gailhoustet. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Exhibition

It is comprised of over 500 3d-printed game pieces sourced from the past, present and future of London's urban morphology. It seeks to engage audiences with the logics of city planning, whether young or old. 

Inspired by Archizoom's 'No Stop City', the game uses the mirrored faces to allow the players to propose a city which could go on forever. 

Player 1 acts as the 'Administrator', pulling cards at random each with a different objective for the city, peeping into the cabinet to instruct Player 2 who acts as the Architect, following these instructions and popping down city fragments in various configurations. Curious onlookers are invited to peep in to the cabinet and participate.

Peep Pop City was played by gamers, grandmas, kids and hipsters at Now Play This 2018, an experimental games festival at Somerset House. It was supported by Now Play This and the Bartlett Architecture Research Fund. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Exhibition

As a result, there is much research on the way neighbourhoods become the content of media and how media could be instrumentalised to improve local communities, but there is a lack of synthesis of media and built environment research allowing a nuanced understanding of the role of communication technology in neighbourhood life. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a richer set of interlinked concepts and methods than that which is currently available to describe urban communications. Existing theoretical frameworks are expanded upon through critical development of a number of approaches to ‘placing’ the main hyperlocal news blog for one neighbourhood: mapping the locations it discusses; analysing the geographical and network characteristics of its social media network; and the development of grounded theory about the use of media in the neighbourhood through qualitative interviews.
The main arguments hold that even at the hyperlocal scale, theories of the national public sphere can help understand the way that imaginaries of place are formed through media; that a focus on subjective imaginaries and non-instrumental storytelling enables a better description of hyperlocal media use than on its instrumental value; and that neighbourhoods should be described as communication ecologies formed of multi-modal actor-networks of people, places, and technologies, rather than as separate spatial and virtual realities. The findings are largely methodological, demonstrating the possibility of placing media by mapping the issues it frames; of illustrating links between spatial morphology and the distribution of issues and social media networks; of using qualitative data to spatialize theories of the formation of the public sphere; and a proposition for a new method for building a socio-technical interaction network demonstrating the structure of the hyperlocal communication ecology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Thesis / Dissertation

Abstract
This paper argues that the concept of ‘sustainability’ is best approached in terms of the factors favourable to the persistence of socio-economic activity in a given centre over time. It suggests that the question of how some places are able to‘re-invent’ themselves over successive historical periods lies at the heart of what sustainability actually means.

The absence of a strong definition of sustainability, often misinterpreted as an exclusively environmental term, has impeded proper understanding of the temporality it strongly implies. This is particularly true in the field of urban design where the relation of the built environment to socio-economic change is poorly theorised and rarely integrated into methodology.

This issue is addressed in this paper by drawing on preliminary research conducted by the EPRSC’s Successful Suburban Town Centres project which runs for three years at UCL. A critical examination of the literature of sustainability and an evaluation of relevant time-series datasets provided the basis for an heuristic methodology able to distinguish a wide range of ‘successful’ suburban town centres. The methodology comprises a series of filters and sorting criteria employing socio-economic, geographical, historical and morphological data, backed up with fieldwork where necessary and integrated into a GIS.

The selection process produced a sample of suburban centres all of which may be considered to be ‘successful’ in the sense that they continue to function effectively despite histories of socio-economic change and physical transformation. The explanation for this appears to lie in their distinctive combinations of socio-economic diversity and morphological robustness. For this reason it is asserted that the long-term ‘success’ of these suburban centres should be considered as a prerequisite rather than an outcome of ‘sustainability’ which is too abstract a term to sufficiently articulate the particularities of place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

This research enhances standard walkability models with fieldwork that actively engages with the community to understand the factors that shape everyday mobility and walking behaviours. Amongst several factors, public transport accessibility was added as a spatial variable that contributes to walkability, whilst walkable land uses were selected to be appropriate to the specific (UK) context.
 
The model also incorporates an advanced method to evaluate the spatial structure of the street network instead of the standard approach of measuring intersection density. Here, space syntax network analysis methods are used, that examine the spatial relationship across the street network at a range of scales by looking at the geometric relationships between spaces. This method more closely accounts for spatial cognition and human wayfinding principles in the way that it uses the actual pedestrian routes taken through the urban environment as the basis for the evaluation of the street network. This method of assessing street network properties holds the potential for improving both walkability studies, and associated health research. It also aims to increase the awareness of the planning profession of the importance of the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the built environment in shaping walking behaviours, and enabling populations to live healthier lives through higher levels of active transport and physical activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

One of the main determinants of returns from residential investment property is the income obtained from tenants’ rent. Income return is affected by several factors, including residents’ satisfaction and their loyalty (in renewing their lease). The ease with which a landlord can let vacant property also depends upon their reputation, the desirability of the neighbourhood, the rental terms and the properties themselves.
This paper analyses almost 5000 interviews with PRS tenants in the UK, conducted over a four-year period, to investigate determinants of resident satisfaction, loyalty (lease renewal) and willingness to recommend their landlord. Statistical analysis is performed using respondents’ ratings of satisfaction with many aspects of their occupancy as explanatory variables. Comparisons are made between interviewees who renew their lease and those who do not renew.  
The research finds that “ease of doing business” with their landlord is a strong predictor of residents’ satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Other key indicators for lease renewal include relationship management, rent collection and value for money. Tenants’ willingness to recommend their landlord depends mainly on their relationship with their landlord, how the landlord compares with tenants’ previous landlords, and the property management service they receive.
This research should help to improve the landlord – tenant relationship in the Private Rented Sector",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

Conventional planning theory tends to assume a logical, rational and linear decision-making process, which bears little relationship to reality. This book aims to shed some light on that reality. The King’s Cross scheme is one of the largest and most complex developments taking place in Britain today. The planning negotiations, which took six years, were probably some of the most exhaustive debates around a development ever. A report of over 600 pages of technical information was eventually presented to the committee, and after two evenings and ten hours of presentations and debate, the committee approved the scheme by just two votes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book

In particular, the book examines how the city contains narratives, knowledge and contested materialities that are best accessed through the act of walking.

The varied contributions take the form of short stories, illustrated essays, personal reflections and accounts of walks both real and fictional. While artist and RCA tutor Rut Blees Luxemburg and philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy recount a nocturnal journey from Shoreditch to the City of London; architect Peter St John of the practice Caruso St John offers a detailed and personal reflection on the Holloway Road; and architect and author Douglas Murphy examines what he calls London’s ‘more politically charged locations’ in his account of a solitary walk through an area of South London. Ultimately, Walking Cities: London seeks to understand the wider significance of changing geographies to generate critical questions and creative perspectives for navigating the social and political impact of rapid urban change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book

At these events, new Company leaders symbolically received corporate endorsement by participating in investiture ceremonies in front of an elite group of Company members and their selected guests. Though all in attendance enjoyed lavish spreads of food and drink, each table received varying, carefully apportioned dishes designed to ensure honour and city hierarchies were upheld.
As a compilation of incredibly detailed accounts for many consecutive years of corporate dining, the Drapers’ Company Dinner Book is extraordinary. It records the organisation of the Company’s dinners and the supply of items of food and drink, as well as the names of guests in the hall and employees in the kitchen. Food gifts sent out after the dinner are recalled comprehensively (which on one occasion consisted of 162 venison pasties). During the period covered by the Dinner Book, new trading corporations and accelerated city growth began to undermine the economic powerbase of London guilds such as the Drapers. Dinner records indicate that the City companies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries recognised the potential of their annual Election Dinners to reinforce the antiquity of corporate authority, inferring a mythical past as a means of legitimizing their stake in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book
