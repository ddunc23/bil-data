In its aftermath, local leaders and corporate developers devised an aggressive redevelopment agenda that would have demolished the homes, workspaces and communities of thousands of council tenants, private renters and traders. Their plan was to transform Tottenham and surrounding areas from a diverse working-class place to a space for wealthy investors, residents and consumers.

Disrupting the Speculative City tells the story of how a community coalition defeated one of the most ambitious programmes of state-led gentrification in London. Known as the ‘Haringey Development Vehicle’ (HDV), it would have been executed through an undemocratic and speculative joint venture between the local council and the notorious international developer Lendlease. Thanks to the political creativity, tactical nous and extraordinary commitment of ordinary people, the HDV was scrapped by the local council in 2018. Drawing on the accounts of those at the heart of the struggle and analysing crucial developments in property investment, local statecraft and grassroots organising, this book explores a significant and inspirational success for campaigners in London, where social cleansing has become the default outcome of redevelopment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book

The focus here is on the interaction in London of markets for land, housing, commercial property, transport and labour - markets which can be instruments of innovation and dynamism but which can also be vectors of exploitation and inequality.

have been limited to computer-aided design (CAD) packages and the query of related da-

rrent innovation wave across the spatial data information field is based on the develop-
ment and dissemination of three-dimensional GIS (3-D GIS) which allows data to be vi-
sualized and queried on an x, y and z axis plane. A number of the key players in informa-

three-dimensional format, currently using the standard Virtual Reality Modeling Language
2.0 (VRML 2.0). However such methods of visualization and data query are limited in their
practicality. The move towards 3-D GIS in standard packages has been rather hit and
miss, with the third dimension often only used as a substitute for basic CAD-like visuali-
zation. We argue here that 3-D GIS will only become a reality when it is directly linked with
CAD models; and that the Internet is the most appropriate medium through which this is
most likely to occur. We illustrate these arguments in an overview of research into the vir-

explore the rise of the global virtual city, a network of virtual cities that provide an insight

Until quite recently the main approach was based on rendering wire frame models of buildings based on Computer-Aided Architectural Design (CAAD/CAD). However, with the widespread development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), there has been a move from the 2d map to the 3d block model which is based on extruding building plots, street line data, and basic topography. At the same time there has been a move towards the distribution of information relating to urban form and its representation via the Internet. Research at CASA into Internet based urban planning techniques has resulted in techniques whereby the common CAD based models of urban form can be adapted into a networked collaborative design and information system.

The institutions of change are constantly undergoing reform and modernisation, in order to set a strategic framework for growth and investment. But choosing an appropriate governing and institutional framework for London has always been problematic. As Travers (2004: 1) has remarked

Governing London is a complex business. The city’s vast population, its geography and history conspire to make the British capital an unusually difﬁ cult place to govern . . .

One approach to thinking about trend-breaking futures is to use visioning and backcasting as a form of scenario building. This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60% reduction target in CO2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting policy packages that are in turn assembled into clusters of policy packages to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the policy packages are used to a ‘high’ level of application. When international aviation is included and the expected growth in travel over the next 20 years, the impossibility of target achievement is clearly demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

We begin by sketching how employment models based on input–output and multiplier relationships are used to predict future employment aggregates by type and then we illustrate how these aggregates are distributed to small zones of an urban region in ways that make them consistent with the distribution of population and service employment allocated using spatial interaction-allocation models. In essence, the structure we are developing, which is part of an integrated assessment of resilience to extreme events, links input–output analysis to the allocation of employment and population using traditional land use transportation interaction models. The framework then down scales these activities which are allocated to small zones to the physical level of the city using GIS-related models functioning at an even finer spatial scale. The crucial link in this chain is how we distribute detailed employment types generated from the input–output model to small zones consistent with the way population and services are allocated using the LUTI model. To achieve this, we introduce an explicit employment forecasting model in which employment types are related to functions of floorspace that they use. These are estimated using linear regression analysis which enables future predictions of their location to be scaled in proportion to the totals generated from the input–output framework. These future estimates of floorspace condition the supply side of the model, and combined with accessibility indicators, provide the heart of the employment location model. We have developed this model for London and its region – south east England – and after presenting the results of the model, we sketch how the integrated framework is being used to generate scenarios for future employment and population change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

These debates are associated with two parallel developments: First, the reassessment of space in the (global) economy and the ‘rediscovery of the city’ that took place from the 1980s onwards in several fields of academic enquiry (Amin and Graham, 1997). This work challenged earlier predictions (Toffler, 1980) that questioned the importance of space in economic, social, and work relationships in face of technological and economic transformations. Second, changes in cultural and local economic policy, which became increasingly intertwined and brought culture “to the centre of policy- making as a potential economic resource” (O’Connor, 2010, 31). Policies initially focused on flagship cultural projects and city marketing and later developed into strategies aiming at fostering creative cities or clusters. Scholarship and policy on these issues, however, stem from distinct conceptual and empirical bases (Landry and Bianchini, 1995; Florida, 2002; 2005; Pratt, 2011) suggesting that ‘the nature of the relationship between the creative economy and the city, in real or aspirational governance terms, is far from settled’ (Pratt and Hutton, 2013, 92).",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

The five stages of network formation are problematization, interessement, enrolment, mobilization and stabilization. The water system of London is a mostly stable set of network relations.

Along with urban climate factors, a number of behavioral factors are further contributing to a significant rise in cooling demand across the EU including countries with a more moderate climate, such as the UK. This chapter investigates environmental and behavioral factors affecting residential air conditioning use in two large EU cities with different climates – Athens and London. This scoping study analyses carbon and health implications of increasing cooling demand, and identifies important physical attributes and occupants’ behavioral patterns that affect air conditioning use, as well as, typical operational temperatures and schedules. The high satisfaction with domestic air conditioning units highlighted in both studies suggests that in the foreseeable future with changing climate the UK may experience a similar increase in market penetration of domestic air conditioning as has occurred in Greece over the last 20 years. This might have a major impact on the summer electricity load and domestic sector carbon emissions in the UK, which already accounts for almost 30% of the UK building stock emission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Thrift, a proponent of non-representational theory conceptualises space as an emergent property of practice that occurs prior to conscious definitions. Hence, space is a site of open-ended possibilities, a non-discursive affordance to life in a given locale. Conversely, place is a more conscious and meaningful construction that people use to understand the space they live in. Although it is a complex construction in its own right, ‘a constellation of processes rather than a thing’ (Massey 2005, 141), place is distinguished by including social narratives and meanings. The concept of place, therefore, extends beyond non-reflexive practices and material flows, incorporating instead purposeful social action in the form of political activities, values, norms, memories, stories and histories. This interplay between spatial materialities, socialities and culture, which transforms a generic space into a culturally charged place, is conventionally known as place-making. Place-making activities occur when we make efforts to define, understand, experience, navigate, utilise, modify or regulate what is happening in and with space. Therefore, place-making activities bridge between space and place. They draw on the mundane practices that serve to extend or maintain local social networks through face-to-face interaction, in addition to more purposive efforts to build a sense of place and belonging. Place-making then, is about the production of locality:  the set of processes that communities used to build a sense of place out of space (Appadurai 1996; Feld and Baso 1996). It involves turning a seemingly generic, ambiguous, unruly or ‘fuzzy’ site of spatial possibility into a more meaningful and social entity, where we recognise ourselves in relation to others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

The project investigated five present-day temporary projects sited on vacant land in London. Conscious of the long history of creative temporary occupations, the project pushes against the ephemeral nature of interim projects of the past, strategically documenting the five case studies through interviews, film, site surveys and photographs.
The specific purpose of this paper is to contextualise this recent fieldwork against the wider historical background of the creative temporary uses of vacant urban space, therefore negotiating between definitions of ‘vacant’ and ‘empty’. Vacant spaces have been historically associated with dereliction or abandonment, ‘lost space’ (Trancik 1986), ‘urban voids’ and ‘cracks in the city’ (Loukaitou-Sideris 1996). Against the perception of vacancy as waste and emptiness, a more positive reading has been promoted through the notion of the ‘terrain vague’ (de Sola-Morales 1995).
Although the present-day case studies emerged out of a very particular political, economic and cultural context, that of the late-2000s recession, this is not the first time that temporary uses have emerged in the history of London. Some of the case studies of the research project are located on sites with legacies of use that stretch back far beyond the 20th century and such histories complicate our readings of these short-term projects. The paper is however primarily concerned with the post-war context of London, up to the present day. Using the case studies as a spur for reflection, it provides an overview of the key moments in the evolution of creative temporary projects developed in vacant spaces. The discussion
also highlights links between past and present projects. Setting out from the post-war reconstruction years, the paper explores the 1960s countercultural projects as well as the 1970s post-countercultural community garden movement and the urban ecology turn. It then considers the impact of an increasingly global environmental awareness in the 1980s, leading up to the 1990s regeneration boom. This broad survey is supported by specific historical examples of creative use - some of which have proved to be truly temporary whilst
others have managed to endure - explored through published material, interviews with initiators and archival photographic records.
Through this historical review the paper links London projects to wider movements worldwide, with particular references to US and Europe where a direct influence can be established. Key themes emerging that provide insights into practices and ideologies relating to ‘emptiness’ are discussed and their legacies for contemporary urban projects identified. The paper observes that there has been a historical evolution in how ‘empty space’ has been discovered, made visible and reimagined in 20th century London, and highlights its relevance for today’s vacant urban spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Much of the critical literature on neoliberal urban development and many of the policy frameworks that shape planning systems characterise the real estate and investment sectors in a relatively simplified way. They are often presented, implicitly or explicitly, as a unified interest with a clear subjectivity built around: 'fast' returns from investment decisions; a lack of consideration for broader public interests; outlooks dominated by the conversion of places into profit maximising investment spaces; and counter-productive approaches towards citizens and government authorities who potentially seek to disrupt their programmes and projects. Such characterisations are becoming increasingly important as regulators in major cities such as London and Toronto are calling for the introduction of new policy technologies and techniques to try and exert greater territorial control over increasingly fluid investment flows, real estate actors and other institutions within cities. Through this chapter we will challenge these preconceived notions relating to real estate actor behaviour and demonstrate their more nuanced, integrated and essential role within London's politics of planning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

In this chapter, I first interrogate these arguments, using qualitative evidence, before turning to the case study of a still-unfolding major infrastructure-led redevelopment, Crossrail, around Tottenham Court Road Station in central London, to highlight the more profound ways that LGBTQ+ venues are networked into processes of urbanization. In this case, in 2006, we see the first attempt by City Hall to name a threat to a venue specifically because of its negative impact on a protected minority, defined under the category of ‘sexual orientation’. We also witness the first uses, in London, of online campaigns to express community objection to the potential loss of venues. A formal equalities impact assessment process highlighted the threat to one of the capital’s biggest and most stridently commercial gay club nights, aligned as it was with international business and property interests. Smaller-scale venues in the vicinity, including those proactively inclusive of more marginalized LGBTQ+ people, were overlooked and closed. Often opportunistically located in precarious sites and buildings during temporary breaks in redevelopment cycles, LGBTQ+ venues of all models are vulnerable once those cycles accelerate. Under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, following a crisis of closures in 2015, and after a period of extensive activism to protect and reopen queer spaces, licensed LGBTQ+ venues have now been categorized as ‘social and cultural infrastructure’ in policy discussions. I frame this designation by turning to earlier empirical studies of lesbian and gay populations’ networks from the late 1960s, and to debates about relationality in queer theory of the 2000s. I propose that thinking of today’s LGBTQ+ venues as queer infrastructure encapsulates the profile of dispersed, interconnected, heterogeneous LGBTQ+ communities in London, and the ways these attach to, traverse, and disrupt international lines of property, heritage, and identity in processes of social and cultural reproduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

that employ the underground, particularly spaces of travel such as the London

seems to be replaced by a heightened awareness of time (the Tube journey). Yet, this
absence of space paradoxically makes the Underground more immanent – an
imaginative space shot through with narrative potential. Indeed, the films I explore
also turn the banal experience of the Underground – that of everyday travel – into a
more complex one, in which the spaces of the Victorian underground return as spaces
of horror. The mapping of those spaces reveals how the imagined city relates to its
physical counterpart, and how the present city relates to its Victorian forebear, tracing
a rich spatial experience of the underground that is usually absent in the contemporary

Evidence from past heatwave periods indicates that London’s Urban Heat Island effect contributes substantially to heat-related mortality rates. During a warm period in 2006, the proportion of heat deaths attributable to this effect was estimated to be 37.7% in outer London, 46.6% in inner London and 47.2% in central London, compared to a reference rural location. The relative effect of the heat island needs to be also examined in conjunction with the influence of individual building geometry, fabric and system characteristics. Epidemiological analyses of London mortality records have demonstrated that the spatial variation of heat-related mortality in London reflects background mortality rates related to population age. As such, higher levels of excess heat-related mortality occur in areas towards the outskirts of London with larger proportions of older residents. Housing features, however, cause a larger variation in temperature exposure and associated risks than the heat island intensity alone.

The chapter responds to calls for more evaluation and reflections on transdisciplinary research projects. We present a formative, developmental evaluation approach. Developmental evaluation is an iterative process supporting programme innovation, adaptation in changing and complex contexts. As an evaluation approach, it provides methodological flexibility to support adaptation - with a focus on nurturing learning as a core goal. In the case study of Thamesmead, a developmental evaluation approach was used to help frame concepts, track developments and share reflections.

Then, in 2002, the UK government introduced a new progressive beer duty tax which enabled small-scale brewers to brew beer while paying less tax than their larger competitors, thus levelling the uneven financial playing field that economies of scale had created. This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made. This new scene reflects London’s global status, showcasing the planetary influences shaping one of the most exciting contemporary beer landscapes in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Chapter

Painstakingly constructed, the stories assemble a sequence of improbable marriages between architecture and story, encompassing a retelling of the Three Little Pigs at Smithfield, a dating agency at Battersea, and a ringed transport system manifesting as a celestial river over the great metropolis. Drawing on a wealth of literary symbolism from Carroll's Alice in Wonderland to Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities and imbued with humour and irony, the book builds on London's rich mix of extravagance and fictive tradition.

Its occupational patterns emerged by observation-based land use, pedestrian and traffic flow surveys correlated with configurational measures that describe its structure.

It is based on findings of research being undertaken by the research project VivaCity 2020, funded by EPSRC (Sustainable Urban Environment Programme). In literature, diversity especially land use diversity has a positive relationship with what is considered a “well-working” urban area. However lived experience suggests that there are no precise description of a “successful” urban environment but it is one of those phenomena that “you know when you see it”. The paper deals with the notion of differentiation and choice that diversity implies, and the concepts of legibility and intelligibility, introduced by Lynch and Hillier respectively, to retrieve identities and structures from the physical environment that surrounds us. Through an analysis of correlation of spatial and occupational patterns, based on space syntax methodology, Clerkenwell is found to be a fragmented but structured system of different centers of activity developed around locally strategic streets. This paper argues that one part of its success lies in exactly the maintenance of a relatively complex and difficult to understand whole composed of relatively easy to understand parts. This may account for the longevity and diversity of local economy and urban fabric. Perhaps this can become a model for urban planners and decisions makers in seeking to reproduce the vibrancy of the 19th century European city.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

As a result, flooding is expected to occur more frequently in London. Flood simulation modelling has previously been done to predict the impact on the built environment for a variety of scenarios for London. However, such models have not taken into account the detailed hygric behaviour of the building stock under flooding and drying conditions which can vary significantly between property types, and can lead to prolonged damp and health problems. To address this problem, a building stock model of central London has been developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), with information on the age, structure, and height of each dwelling and assumptions about built form based on historical building standards and surveys. This paper describes a novel methodology for the development of a building stock model with the necessary information to carry out hygrothermal simulations of the penetration of water into the building envelopes of flooded homes and the subsequent drying under different environmental scenarios. It discusses how the risk of damp in flooded homes can be modelled using hygrothermal methods and supplemented with mould models. By combining the multidisciplinary components of GIS, building simulation, and microbiological modelling, a holistic picture of the potential health implications of flooding at a population level across different temporal and spatial scales can be developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

In “pricing accessibility”, Webster(2009) argues the need to value the built form morphology. One perspective in understanding thebuilt environment morphology is through its spatial configuration.

We investigated the spatial variation in heat-related mortality risks across London due to population age, urban heat island (UHI) and building characteristics. Methods Dynamic building physics models were run for 126 different age and built form variants of buildings statistically representative of the London housing stock, outputting average maximum daily internal temperatures for a hot summer period in 2006. Internal and modelled UHI temperature estimates for the same period in London were mapped to individual dwellings in Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and deviations of building-specific indoor and outdoor temperatures from the London-average were calculated and summarised at ward level. Office of National Statistics age-specific absolute mortality data and the above-calculated UHI and indoor temperature anomalies were then used to estimate spatial variation in mortality according to an age-specific relative risk function for heat in London. Results There was appreciable variation in indoor temperatures under the modelled climate, with a mean maximum range of 2.5°C. Modelled results indicate that the largest mortality risks may lie in outer London, as the elderly population is larger there than in Central London. Top-floor flats in multiple occupancy buildings and bungalows were found to be the most at-risk dwelling types. Limitations in building stock information and occupancy scenario assumptions mean that some buildings may be worse than modelled. Conclusions These results indicate that UHI and indoor temperatures may cause an appreciable spatial variation in the risks from heat-related mortality, but that the driving factor remains population age. Further work is required to explore the risks for individuals living in extreme heat-poor housing conditions or for those unable to take action to cool the indoor environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

Median house prices are now more than ten times median incomes, additions to the stock are insufficient, and prices are volatile. In the search for remedies, well-intended solutions emerging from fragmented analyses of the problem inevitably lead to unintended consequences. The incapacity of the human mind to correctly infer the behaviour of complex systems presents a case for System Dynamics. This paper, the result of the first year of a PhD, describes the underlying socio-economic structure responsible for the Housing crisis in London.

Organisations look for agile strategies to strike an adequate balance between employee satisfaction, wellbeing and productivity in one side and the efficiency and effectiveness of utilising the space on the other side. The fast pace of technology development is considered an enabler for agile working. However, there are very few studies done on analysing the interconnected relationship between the social and technical/technological aspects of agile working.
This case study was undertaken on three floors of the headquarter building of a construction and property development company in Central London. The study involved introducing agile working concept in the workplace, including adding social spaces, flexible open plan workstations monitored by Internet of things (IoT) technology i.e. occupancy sensors, implementing a new system of monitoring and managing meeting spaces to maximise the efficiency of space utilisation, and introducing a new Information technology and cybersecurity strategy to allow for this change. The study will analyse the factors that influenced this workplace change such as limitations of space, technology development, and the need for maximising the efficiency of the workplace. It will also analyse the lessons learned from implementing the agile working concept, regarding the role of technology, the social aspects, the business value of this implementation and the relationship between these factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

This exploration is often constrained by the availability of large-scale data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. Longitudinal data, such as the Foursquare data, allow researchers to explore different aspects of the functional structure of cities, such as the role of places and the human mobility that occurs between them. However, never mind their size, this type of data is often incomplete, capturing only parts of the functional city due to the biases in the data collection that might represent a part of the population only. In this paper we explore how Foursquare data can help unveil aspects of the functional structure of London. We explore the spatial pattern of venue locations and visit patterns captured in the Foursquare data. We also touch upon the temporal patterns of these data, as well as the interactions between categories of places (as derived by the semantic information that comes with the venues).

A façade retrofit presented a challenge for resolving potentially conflicting comfort considerations, e.g. large views and glare, with simple installations such as vertical fins. This study identified critical comfort issues and generated an optimized façade design with occupancy survey and multi-objective optimization. Sunlight glare, temperature and stability in winter and summer, and noise from colleagues were identified as key comfort factors, and then parameterized with building simulation programs as optimization objectives. A simple façade design was developed with parametric controls on glazing ratio, shading device, and glazing types. The optimal solution was found to be fully opaque insulation on South and West façades, extensive glazing on the North and East façades, and secondary glazing in all façades. Improvements in the heating system and building envelope was found essential for further thermal comfort improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

It includes threedimensional information about buildings including their heights, volumes, wall areas, floor areas and the distribution of activities between different floors. These data are drawn from University College London Energy Institute’s existing 3DStock model of London. Within the model information is attached on the ages of buildings, their materials of construction, and (in some cases) their servicing systems. Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) are also attached to premises and dwellings along with gas and electricity energy consumption. Buildings in London are responsible for over 65% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributed to the Greater London region in 2016. Reducing CO2 emissions that can be attributed to buildings is the key focus of this work in line with the GLA’s ambition to dramatically reduce these overall CO2 emissions; aiming to make London a zero-carbon city by 2050. Improving the energy performance of existing buildings has to be a key strategy if the overall CO2 emissions are to be reduced. Knowing the characteristics and current energy efficiency of the building stock is the first step towards reducing direct and indirect CO2 emissions from these buildings. Collecting the data is one challenge, but making sense of these huge quantities of data is a bigger challenge. Structuring the data can help here and so for this paper we present the evaluation of energy efficiency of buildings in London using urban density to aggregate the data. Energy efficiency is measured from both EPCs and energy consumption. Some of the existing measures that might influence current energy efficiency are then shown at different levels of urban density. Finally, in order to address the improvement of the energy efficiency we quantify the ‘potential’ improvements of these buildings (according to the EPC recommendations) and hence the suitability of different retrofit solutions, again aggregated by urban density. The results show that energy use intensity decreases as urban density increases; that urban density has some influence on existing efficiency measures and finally that most of the measures of retrofit potential change with increasing urban density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

Reducing energy demand by implementing rapid energy saving measures has been effective in mitigating many electricity shortages globally to date. This thesis investigates whether similar measures could be effective in the UK in the event of a natural gas shortage, using a case study of London’s households. A mail survey was developed and sent to a sample of 1,600 households in London to investigate which energy saving actions respondents would implement in a gas shortage. The questionnaire suggested a hypothetical scenario, where the media and government asked households to save energy for one month and also included questions about the respondents, their households and their dwellings. The resulting energy savings were subsequently calculated for each household using ‘MESAH’, a computer model developed during this research. This model used energy saving estimates based on a review of literature about household activities that use energy. Using these assumptions, the savings achieved by the different households varied vastly, reaching an overall total of approximately 30% of normal gas and electricity use in January. This result was relatively stable during the winter season. It was however found to be very sensitive to assumptions taken about the energy savings, and whether the respondents implemented actions as stated in the survey. It also found that the different actions proposed had very disparate saving impacts. The savings calculated represent high estimates of energy saving potential, rather than predictions due to uncertainties and limitations in the research. The project identified rapid energy savings as an option for an emergency response, but stressed that this approach should only be taken in extreme situations",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference paper (text)

However, how accessibility to public transport is distributed by demographic groups and how it changed over time have not been studied. This study examined the potential unequal distribution of public transport accessibility with a focus on demographic groups defined by ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic status over the past decade, at the LSOA level in the Greater London Area. After accounting for geographical features, car ownership, population density, and spatial autocorrelation in spatial lag models, the disparities for ethnicity were found, as the mixed and other ethnic groups were more disadvantaged both in 2011 and 2021, while the Asian ethnic groups had a more advantaged position. Income also played a role, as wealthier groups tended to have better access to public transport; however, these privileges decreased throughout the decade. The accessibility advantage of the middle-aged and older groups in 2011 diminished significantly by 2021. This was replaced by the median low-level age group, which had the most prominent advantage in tube accessibility.

Understanding the moisture behaviour of solid bricks facing climate change is therefore significant.

The vast majority of solid brick buildings in London are non-insulated. Adding internal wall insulation is one possible energy retrofit measure, however, the insulation layer can alter the moisture balance of the wall. Since the hygrothermal properties of the existing building materials can influence the moisture balance of the wall considerably, identifying the wall type and understanding its hygrothermal properties is extremely important in building retrofit. The objective of this study is to explore the variability of the hygrothermal properties of different bricks from one wall located in London. Several brick samples are selected from one case study wall in London. The hygrothermal properties of 21 historic bricks were measured, including the absorption coefficient, bulk density, drying coefficient, water content at capillary saturation to determine the variability.

Overheating in such cities is expected to be exacerbated in the future as a result of further urban growth and climate change. Demonstrating and quantifying the impact of individual design interventions on the UHI is currently difficult using available software tools. The tools developed in the LUCID ('The Development of a Local Urban Climate Model and its Application to the Intelligent Design of Cities') research project will enable the related impacts to be better understood, quantified and addressed. This article summarises the relevant literature and reports on the ongoing work of the project.Practical applications: There is a complex relationship between built form, urban processes, local temperature, comfort, energy use and health. The UHI effect is significant and there is a growing recognition of this issue. Developers and planners are seeking advice on design decisions at a variety of scales based on scientifically robust, quantitative methods. The LUCID project has thus developed a series of tools that (1) quantify the effect of urbanisation processes on local environmental conditions, and (2) quantify the impact of such conditions on comfort, energy use and health. The use of such tools is vital, both to inform policy but also to be able to demonstrate compliance with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Until relatively recently these models have been developed in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software more often then in GIS. One of the main reasons was that ‘3-D GIS’ was often only 2.5-D under closer inspection. This is changing, and by straddling both technologies, and integrating others, we show how these models in turn enable planning information, statistics, pollution levels, sea level rises and much more to be visualised and analysed in the context of the 3-D city model. The client for ‘Virtual London’ is the Greater London Authority (GLA) and their aim is to develop improved dissemination of planning information, which is explored. We then argue that virtual cities should go well beyond the traditional conceptions of 3-D GIS and CAD into virtual worlds and online design. But we also urge caution in pushing the digital message too far, showing how more conventional tangible media is always necessary in rooting such models in more realistic and familiar representations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Simulations are performed with the urban surfaces represented and with the urban surfaces replaced with grass in order to calculate the urban increment on the local meteorology. The local urban effects were moderated to some extent by the passage of an onshore flow that propagated up the Thames estuary and across the city, cooling London slightly in the afternoon. Validations of screen-level temperature show encouraging agreement to within 1–2 K, when the urban increment is up to 5 K. The model results are then used to examine factors shaping the spatial and temporal structure of London's atmospheric boundary layer. The simulations reconcile the differences in the temporal evolution of the urban heat island (UHI) shown in various studies and demonstrate that the variation of UHI with time depends strongly on the urban fetch. The UHI at a location downwind of the city centre shows a decrease in UHI during the night, while the UHI at the city centre stays constant. Finally, the UHI at a location upwind of the city centre increases continuously. The magnitude of the UHI by the time of the evening transition increases with urban fetch. The urban increments are largest at night, when the boundary layer is shallow. The boundary layer experiences continued warming after sunset, as the heat from the urban fabric is released, and a weakly convective boundary layer develops across the city. The urban land-use fraction is the dominant control on the spatial structure in the sensible heat flux and the resulting urban increment, although even the weak advection present in this case study is sufficient to advect the peak temperature increments downwind of the most built-up areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

VIBAT London study (www.vibat.org) which considers the role of the transport sector in reducing CO2
emissions in London.

The analysis develops a transport and carbon simulation model (TC-SIM) for London. Within this,
users are able to consider the implementation of a series of potential policy packages—low emission
vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimes, public transport, walking and cycling, strategic and local
urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and
slower speeds, long distance travel substitution, freight transport and international air. They can select
variable levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emission reduction targets. The roles of
carbon rationing and oil prices are also considered. TC-SIM can be played in different user modes: as
‘free riders’, ‘techno-optimists’, ‘enviro-optimists’, ‘complacent car addicts’ and other typical travel
market segments, including a ‘free role’. Game playing or scenario testing such as this helps to highlight
perceived levels of homogeneity of views within certain cohorts, the development of entrenched
positions and the likely success in achieving objectives.

The paper develops various policy packages, scenarios and pathways aimed at reducing transport
CO2 emissions. It argues that strategic CO2 emission reduction targets are very ambitious relative to
current progress, and that we need to act more effectively across a wide range of policy mechanisms,
with a ‘high intensity application’ of many of the options, to get near to achieving these targets. A
critical issue here will be in communicating and gaining greater ‘ownership’ of future lifestyle choices
with stakeholders and the public, and participation tools such as TC-SIM could become increasingly
important in this area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The necessary policy measures are available, but at present there is not sufficient political and public support for wide-ranging, effective action. Technology on its own will not be enough. This message is then reinforced with a more local perspective in London where considerable efforts are being made to make London a sustainable city, but even here where opportunities are present, it is the growth in travel and in particular in aviation, that makes transport-based targets very difficult to achieve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

A backcasting study approach was used, and the likely impacts of alternative images of 2025 were tested. A transportation and carbon simulation game was also developed for London. Within this game, users are able to consider a series of potential policy packages, such as low-emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimens, public transportation, walking and cycling, strategic and local urban planning, information and communication technologies, smarter choices, ecological driving and slower speeds, long-distance travel substitution, freight transportation, and international air, and select various levels of application to help achieve headline CO2 emissions reduction targets. The roles of two external enabling measures, carbon rationing and oil pricing, were also considered. The paper considers an optimized policy package for 2025.

Governing a world city like London has always been a difficult process. Legislative commitments to address London's sustainable future have sometimes been undermined by different policy interpretations by different key players over different time periods. This has created a fluid and diverse structure of governance that enables short-term policy shifts but which threatens longer term strategic sustainability policy commitments. These interpretations have occurred against an ongoing and contentious political debate over powers and responsibilities between different scales of the state, and the rights to make key decisions affecting London's future. This has resulted in a policy and governmental structure that is highly dependent on negotiation and compromise and one that employs a variety of policy tools, information and persuasion, financial incentives, and collaboration, to achieve a balanced form of governance. This flexible arrangement enables divergent public attitudes towards sustainability and climate change to be harnessed but may not deliver long term urban sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies.

Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions.

The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a ‘strategic conversation’ at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets.

It is therefore necessary to understand its net impact and adopt strategies to cope with and mitigate its negative aspects. The Lucid project is addressing both these issues and this paper focuses on the second component. There is currently a lack of practical assessment instruments available to planners, designers and developers that can assess a development's impact on the UHI. This paper thus presents a proposal for a multi-scaled UHI assessment tool framework that could be used in developing relevant planning policy and assessing UHI mitigation design strategies.

The gates erected by the Romans on the most important routes in and out of the city were rebuilt on their ancient foundations in the medieval period, when posterns (smaller passageways) were added in the wall and a huge ditch was dug around the outside. By the seventeenth century, there were seven principal gates in the old wall: from east to west starting from the Tower, they were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate and Ludgate. On the bridge across the River Thames – the only point of entry to the City from the south – there were two more gates. The ditch, as John Stow recorded in his Survey of London (first published in 1598), was ‘of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon’. This treatment of the ditch points to how the urban fabric had long since pushed through the gates and beyond the old walls; this area ‘without’, but still under the City’s jurisdiction, was known as the Liberties. In Hollar’s map of London in the later seventeenth century (Fig. 1), the walls and gates are a clearly visible feature defining the core of the City, which none the less spreads beyond them, in particular to the west. The limits of the Liberties were marked on main roads by ‘bars’, usually consisting of posts and chains, as at Holborn (to the north) or Whitechapel (to the east). Temple Bar, however, situated on Fleet Street to the west of Ludgate, had been made a gateway by the mid-fourteenth century, a reflection of its importance as the main point of transition between the Cities of London and Westminster. As such Temple Bar was considered one of the City gates; it was the eighth gate in the engraved plate that accompanied John Strype’s version of Stow’s Survey, published in 1720.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The annual primary energy demand was 125kWh/m2, marginally above the 120 kWh/m2 target. The measured internal heat gains of 3.65 W/m2 are much greater than the 2.1 W/m2 suggested as standard for dwellings.

The dual representation of a planar graph is a content-based network, where each node is a set of edges of the planar graph and represents a transportation unit in the so-called information space, i.e., the space where information is handled in order to navigate through the city. First, we discuss a novel hybrid technique to extract dual graphs from planar graphs, called the hierarchical intersection continuity negotiation principle. Then we show that the growth of the network can be analytically described by logistic laws and that the topological properties of the network are governed by robust log-normal distributions characterizing the network's connectivity and small-world properties that are consistent over time. Moreover, we find that the double-Pareto-like distributions for the connectivity emerge for major roads and can be modeled via a stochastic content-based network model using simple space-filling principles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Driven by the European Union's 20-20- 20 strategy, Governments throughout Europe have implemented policies to support renewable generation and energy efficiency. In the UK, a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme was launched in 2010 and has been so successful in creating growth in the PV market that tariff digression has had to be accelerated. A loan scheme, the Green Deal, which provides up front capital for energy efficiency measures was launched in 2012.

Despite the success of the FiT scheme, the penetration of PV in London has lagged behind other areas. In this paper we examine the reasons for this by taking Berlin and the German policy of Feed-in Tariffs and soft-loans as a comparator and modeling the effect of tariff rates and loan availability on uptake in London to understand the impact the Green Deal might have on the UK PV market. Further, we address another important consideration for policy, namely, shortcomings in the field performance of PV systems through the comparison of theoretical and measured performance. It is concluded that soft-loans would have a limited impact on market growth when compared with the effect of providing increased FiT rates to social landlords.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It draws on detailed monitoring data from a sample of 18 classrooms from 6 London schools. Overheating during the non-heating season was identified in eight south-, south-east-, and east-facing classrooms in two Victorian and two contemporary schools. Four classrooms in these contemporary schools also failed to keep average indoor CO2 levels below 1500 ppm in the non-heating season. During the heating season, eight classrooms exceeded the daily average indoor CO2 levels. Mean indoor particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 levels recorded in all classrooms in both seasons were higher than 20 and 10 μg/m3, respectively, indicating that school exposure during an academic year may exceed annual recommended WHO [Citation2006.

In both seasons, all classrooms were found to have indoor total volatile organic compounds levels (median: 269 ppb and interquartile range: 64–408 ppb) above guideline thresholds (130 ppb) associated with sensory irritations. Identification of specific volatile organic compounds indicated the presence of strong indoor sources including furniture, cleaning products, and teaching materials. Findings suggest that these school classrooms often have poor IAQ due to a combination of sub-optimal building operation and management practices. Furthermore, while CO2 and ventilation rates are a useful tool for IAQ assessment, findings indicate that consideration of specific pollutants is necessary to ensure a healthy indoor environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The impacts of the roofing strategies were split into the direct and indirect effects. The indirect effects of the roofs were modelled using microclimatic modelling software. The results indicate the direct effects of green and cool roofs at reducing overheating are much greater than the indirect cooling effect. A non-insulated cool roof was found to be the most effective strategy. By insulating the roof, the level of overheating was slightly reduced. Non-insulated green and cool roofs were more effective than insulated roofs at reducing levels of overheating.

These technologies were compared to application of retrofitting traditional insulation. Initial microclimatic modelling of the impact of the roofs showed that both green and cool roofs can reduce air temperatures directly above their surfaces, with maximum air temperature reductions of 1 °C. The results of the microclimatic modelling were then used as input into a whole building thermal simulation model, in order to assess the direct and indirect effects of the roofs. The building modelling results indicate that in the current climate, green roofs reduce annual energy use within the building. The level of savings are reduced when green roofs are dry in the summer. Cool roofs are more effective in the summer, but result in an annual energy penalty due to their performance in winter. In a 2050 climate scenario, both green and cool roofs result in a reduction in annual energy use. The application of traditional insulation is the most effective technology at reducing annual energy use. Adding insulation and a green or cool roof reduces the relative effectiveness of the roofs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

This study tested how these different design summer years impacted the assessment of overheating in a naturally ventilated office in London. Two office designs were tested, an uninsulated and one retrofitted with insulation and night cooling. The choice of baseline year impacted the level of overheating for both the uninsulated and retrofitted models. Tested in the more severe years, 1976 and 2003, the offices experienced the highest levels of overheating. When an office was retrofitted and night cooled, the choice of location had more of animpact on overheating due to the urban heat island effect. London Weather Centre and Heathrow experienced higher levels of overheating than Gatwick. The study highlights the need for designers to carefully consider how the differences between the weather files will impact their overheating assessment depending on their buildings’ fabric and ventilation design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Fungal and bacterial groups and allergens were sampled with suction-based methods in settled dust and endotoxin levels were sampled in dust collected with natural deposition. Biological contaminants were analysed with molecular, cultivation-independent methods. The strong temporal and spatial variability of outdoor NO2 levels affected indoor levels and is therefore an important consideration when selecting sites for new school buildings. There is a need to further clarify on the effect of finishing, such as wall-to-wall carpeting, which may act as a significant reservoir of irritants and allergens and impact school IAQ.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

This paper presents an evaluation framework for the climate change resilience of the London social housing stock that combines dynamic thermal modelling to assess the impact of retrofit on current and future indoor temperatures and a carbon and economic analysis of retrofit packages to predict their ranking based on the priorities of different socio-economic groups. Under the 2050s High emissions scenario, 90th percentile probability, unventilated flats in the case study building were found to overheat in the future (63% increase compared to the current climate), while natural ventilation kept the overheating hours within acceptable limits. Internally applied wall insulation combined with low ventilation rates could potentially increase future overheating (48% increase). Fixed shading had a reverse impact, reducing the overheating hours by 28%, but increasing the winter heating demand by 19.5% compared to the pre-retrofit performance of the building. Movable external louvers provided a better balance between cooling and heating needs, reducing the overheating hours by 37.5% and increasing heating demand by 8%. The study findings indicate the need for optimization of social housing retrofit packages in order to combine carbon emissions reduction with future climate resilience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It assesses the impacts and outcomes of so-called new localist reforms and argues that we are witnessing two principal trends. First, governance processes are increasingly dominated by anti-democratic development machines, characterized by new assemblages of public- and private-sector experts. These machines reflect and reproduce a type of development politics in which there is a greater emphasis on a pragmatic realism and a politics of delivery. Second, the presence of these machines is having a significant impact on the politics of planning. Democratic engagement is not seen as the basis for new forms of localism and community control. Instead, it is presented as a potentially disruptive force that needs to be managed by a new breed of skilled private-sector consultant. The paper examines these wider shifts in urban politics before focusing on the connections between emerging development machines and local residential and business communities. It ends by highlighting some of the wider implications of change for democratic modes of engagement and nodes of resistance in urban politics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It is offered with a view to help better identify the distribution of the projects costs and benefits and shed greater light on the possible ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ over space and time, and under given scenarios.
Drawing from an extensive array of public domain literature the paper sets out both the policy and planning contexts for the project plus the business case that led to a decision by UK Treasury to guar- antee a £1 billion loan to Transport for London for the construction of the Northern Line's extension. The paper looks at the scale and nature of the megaproject's features, particularly its line-haul and related real estate developments, especially those in the assigned development opportunity area. The text presents the policy, planning, legislative and regulative dimensions of the project likely to define its revenue generation prospects and environmental and social impacts, with special attention paid to those project outcomes affecting key stakeholders over time and space. The paper also seeks to explain the mechanics of how to employ a policy-led multi-criteria framework together with its associated processes within which stakeholder policies and agendas can be mapped and common/divergent interests iden- tified. This is done with a view to ultimately facilitate stakeholder negotiation decision-making trade-offs in given scenarios under the policy guidance of the Greater London Authority with the support of the Treasury of the UK Government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

This is largely due to the fact that the travel associated with such transport is highly ordered. Travellers move collectively in closed vehicles between fixed stops and their entry into and from the system is unambiguous and easy to automate using smart cards. Flows can thus be easily calculated at specific station locations and bus stops and within fine temporal intervals. Here we outline work we have been doing using a remarkable big data set for public transport in Greater London generated from the smart card data called the Oyster Card which has been in use for over 13 years. We explore the generic properties of the Tube and Overground rail system focussing first on the scale and distribution of the flow volumes at stations, then engaging in an analysis of temporal flows that can be decomposed into various patterns using principal components analysis (PCA which smooth out normal fluctuations and leave a residual in which significant deviations can be tracked and explained. We then explore the heterogeneity in the data set with respect to how travel behaviour varies over different time intervals and suggest how we can use these ideas to detect and manage disruptions on the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

As budget cuts continue to affect local government in England, this paper concludes that although small experiments in participatory gov- ernance may persist, the dominant mode of governance is likely to shift towards more hierarchical and coercive forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants—contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The paper then turns to the language of enabling as found in policy and academic literature and argues both that changes in the language of policy have been distinctive and that this is actively contributing to the new urban governance.

Never has so much anticipation and expectation been placed on one single area-based project. It is expected to simultaneously: generate new job opportunities for hard-to-reach groups of the unemployed; bring about the regeneration of some of Europe’s most deprived neighbourhoods; lead to increases in sports participation; generate positive health outcomes; and even help to stave off recession in London by acting as a Keynesian boost in the midst of austerity (see for example The Economist (Citation2013)). For urban policy researchers the London Games thus represents a unique policy experiment; it is a location in which over £10 billion of area-based expenditure has been mobilised at the same time as local communities have faced the biggest mainstream welfare cuts in a generation.

With road space in urban centers being increasingly reallocated to pavement widening, and bus and cycle lanes, there is growing interest in alternative solutions to the last-mile delivery problem. We make three contributions in this paper: firstly, through empirical analysis using carrier operational datasets, we quantify the characteristics of last-mile parcel operations and demonstrate the reliance placed on walking by vehicle drivers with their vans being parked at the curbside for on average 60% of the total vehicle round time; secondly, we introduce the concept of “portering” where vans rendezvous with porters who operate within specific geographical “patches” to service consignees on foot, potentially saving 86% in driving distance on some rounds and 69% in time; finally, we highlight the wider practical issues and optimization challenges associated with operating driving and portering rounds in inner urban areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The consensus around this belief has been almost unanimous, despite the contradiction between the idea of scarcity and that of vacancy. This paper explores the assumptions underpinning this contradiction to point to new ways of addressing the ‘vacant land problem’. Drawing on the work of Lefebvre and Massey, the paper suggests a dialectical framing of vacant land to understand how its socially constructed nature shapes its transformation. The paper reveals a static understanding of urban change behind the conceptualisation of Battersea Power Station and Silvertown Quays as ‘bad places’, which in turn legitimises and shapes their transformation. The paper argues for a re-problematisation of ‘vacant land’, whereby its function as a planning tool for growth can be challenged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

There is increasing interest in green infrastructure in connection with these challenges. In order to go beyond an understanding of the effects of green infrastructure and develop an understanding of how policymakers should think about it, we need to capture potential interactions and be aware of possible unintended consequences. 

In our research, we applied a systems-thinking approach: integrating participatory engagements, qualitative system dynamics modelling, and an assessment framework in order to address the challenge. This allowed us to see multiple dynamics between the prioritisation of policymakers, different types of green infrastructure, and environmental and health outcomes. It also made us ask different and more integrated questions, and suggested a methodology for addressing the challenge of transforming cities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Empirical application of expenditure diary instrument to quantify relationships between in-store and online grocery shopping: Case study of greater London,,,,,10.3141/2496-06,"Suel E, Le Vine S, Polak J",,,,"There is a sustained shift of certain types of retail activity away from in-store shopping and toward online retailing, with potentially structural consequences for shopping-related mobility. In the United Kingdom, for instance, 5.1% of spending on groceries in 2013 was transacted online, an increase from 3.8% in 2010. (The level was 1.1% in 2003.) Transport researchers face serious gaps in empirical data coverage of this phenomenon, however, because regional and national travel surveys typically collect limited information with which to establish how in-store and online shopping relate to one another. To address this issue, the authors employed a well-established data resource in a novel approach. The UK Living Costs and Food Survey is traditionally used to track aggregate household expenditure patterns and to monitor price inflation. This study drew on the unique nature of the survey's expenditure diary, in which respondents recorded each item that they purchased during a 2-week period; respondents also recorded whether each shopping occasion was in-store or online. Empirically, it was found that shopping basket characteristics (types of products being purchased) were significantly linked with channel choice (online versus in-store). Furthermore, with a twostage modeling approach, it was found that sociodemographic factors appeared to relate in different ways to adoption of online shopping in general and to the choice of online versus in-store for individual shopping occasions. The paper closes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

NDLOVU-GATSHENI, London, Routledge, 2022",,,,,10.1017/err.2022.43,Patel K,,,,"In the international development and charity sector, particularly in the UK but not exclusively, crises of safeguarding vulnerable people have driven relatively large-scale investment in risk management and boosted its importance in charity governance. In 2018, British newspaper The Times published an exposé of the international non-governmental organisation (INGO) Oxfam GB and its handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct of its staff in Haiti and the Philippines (known colloquially as the “Oxfam-Haiti scandal”). An investigation into Oxfam GB by the Charity Commission, a government body that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales, found that the organisation’s safeguarding strategy, approach and resourcing were significant areas of weakness that meant “the charity exposed itself to undue risk, amounting to mismanagement in the administration of the charity”.Footnote 1 The lever of exposure to risks – including the risk of causing harm to others alongside reputational risks – led to major sector-wide investment and the growth of teams of safeguarding professionals that introduced new or shored up existing policies, practices, lines of reporting and accountability and engendered behavioural change. By 2022, the international development and charity sector has become well versed and proactive in its management and mitigation of risks within the organisation and those caused by the organisation. These are risks that can be known, boxed into processes attentive to them and contained so that organisations may continue their substantive work. This framework and approach to understanding and managing risk as an operational exercise seems profoundly unsuited to the next great challenge facing the international development and charity sector and the development sector more widely – a challenge that aims to undo its rules and institutions and disrupt its very paradigm of knowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

Exploring the Effects of Light and Dark on Crime in London,,,,,10.3390/ijgi13060182,"Erturk E, Raynham P, Teji JU",,,,"Safety from crime is a fundamental human need. In Maslow’s hierarchy, safety is one of the foundational needs of well-being. The built environment should be safe to use at all times of the day and for all groups of people. After dark, the appearance of the outdoor environment changes dramatically, and this could impact the opportunities for crime. This study investigated the impact of daylight on the rates of different types of crime by comparing the crime rates during selected periods of daylight and darkness. The study used records of crime data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By studying crimes in the week on either side of the twice-yearly clock change, it is possible to compare periods that are dark in one week and light in the other at the same clock time. Where the time at which the crime took place was known, and using the GPS coordinates of the specific crime, the solar altitude was calculated and used to determine if it was light or dark at the time of the crime. A similar calculation was used to see if the crime would have been in the dark or light in the week on the other side of the clock change. The headline result is that there was 4.8% (OR 1.07) more crime in the dark periods than the light ones. However, this increase was not uniform across all crime types, and there were some further complications in some results due to potential changes in the behavior of some victims after dark. For the crimes of theft from a person and robbery of personal property, there was a significant increase during the dark period. The availability of light had an impact on the rate of certain crimes. Whilst this does not provide any information about the impact of street lighting on crime, it does provide some idea of by how much crime could be reduced if better lighting was provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Journal article

The Blog and the Territory: placing hyperlocal media and its publics in a London neighbourhood,,,,,,Bingham-Hall J,,,,"Accounts of communication technology use in neighbourhood life tend to foreground either media or space and treat the other as a backdrop. As a result, there is much research on the way neighbourhoods become the content of media and how media could be instrumentalised to improve local communities, but there is a lack of synthesis of media and built environment research allowing a nuanced understanding of the role of communication technology in neighbourhood life. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a richer set of interlinked concepts and methods than that which is currently available to describe urban communications. Existing theoretical frameworks are expanded upon through critical development of a number of approaches to ‘placing’ the main hyperlocal news blog for one neighbourhood: mapping the locations it discusses; analysing the geographical and network characteristics of its social media network; and the development of grounded theory about the use of media in the neighbourhood through qualitative interviews.
The main arguments hold that even at the hyperlocal scale, theories of the national public sphere can help understand the way that imaginaries of place are formed through media; that a focus on subjective imaginaries and non-instrumental storytelling enables a better description of hyperlocal media use than on its instrumental value; and that neighbourhoods should be described as communication ecologies formed of multi-modal actor-networks of people, places, and technologies, rather than as separate spatial and virtual realities. The findings are largely methodological, demonstrating the possibility of placing media by mapping the issues it frames; of illustrating links between spatial morphology and the distribution of issues and social media networks; of using qualitative data to spatialize theories of the formation of the public sphere; and a proposition for a new method for building a socio-technical interaction network demonstrating the structure of the hyperlocal communication ecology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Thesis / Dissertation
Sustainability as the success of a centre over time: the case of Greater London’s suburbs,,,,,,"Griffiths S, Vaughan L, Haklay M, Sahbaz O",,,,"29-31 August 2007

Abstract
This paper argues that the concept of ‘sustainability’ is best approached in terms of the factors favourable to the persistence of socio-economic activity in a given centre over time. It suggests that the question of how some places are able to‘re-invent’ themselves over successive historical periods lies at the heart of what sustainability actually means.

The absence of a strong definition of sustainability, often misinterpreted as an exclusively environmental term, has impeded proper understanding of the temporality it strongly implies. This is particularly true in the field of urban design where the relation of the built environment to socio-economic change is poorly theorised and rarely integrated into methodology.

This issue is addressed in this paper by drawing on preliminary research conducted by the EPRSC’s Successful Suburban Town Centres project which runs for three years at UCL. A critical examination of the literature of sustainability and an evaluation of relevant time-series datasets provided the basis for an heuristic methodology able to distinguish a wide range of ‘successful’ suburban town centres. The methodology comprises a series of filters and sorting criteria employing socio-economic, geographical, historical and morphological data, backed up with fieldwork where necessary and integrated into a GIS.

The selection process produced a sample of suburban centres all of which may be considered to be ‘successful’ in the sense that they continue to function effectively despite histories of socio-economic change and physical transformation. The explanation for this appears to lie in their distinctive combinations of socio-economic diversity and morphological robustness. For this reason it is asserted that the long-term ‘success’ of these suburban centres should be considered as a prerequisite rather than an outcome of ‘sustainability’ which is too abstract a term to sufficiently articulate the particularities of place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

Integrating community engagement and wayfinding principles into the development of a walkability index for London,,,,,,"Dhanani AN, Vaughan L, Boniface S, Anciaes P, Scholes S, Mindell J",,,,"Measuring the walkability of urban environments through the analysis and evaluation of physical environmental characteristics has gained wide acceptance as a method for assessing the potential for physical activity and active transport to take place. This research enhances standard walkability models with fieldwork that actively engages with the community to understand the factors that shape everyday mobility and walking behaviours. Amongst several factors, public transport accessibility was added as a spatial variable that contributes to walkability, whilst walkable land uses were selected to be appropriate to the specific (UK) context.
 
The model also incorporates an advanced method to evaluate the spatial structure of the street network instead of the standard approach of measuring intersection density. Here, space syntax network analysis methods are used, that examine the spatial relationship across the street network at a range of scales by looking at the geometric relationships between spaces. This method more closely accounts for spatial cognition and human wayfinding principles in the way that it uses the actual pedestrian routes taken through the urban environment as the basis for the evaluation of the street network. This method of assessing street network properties holds the potential for improving both walkability studies, and associated health research. It also aims to increase the awareness of the planning profession of the importance of the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the built environment in shaping walking behaviours, and enabling populations to live healthier lives through higher levels of active transport and physical activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

"Determinants of Satisfaction, Loyalty and Landlord Advocacy amongst Private Rented Sector Tenants at East Village, London",,,,,,Sanderson DC,,,,"Over the past five years, the private rented sector has become a significant asset class for institutional investors in the UK. One of the main determinants of returns from residential investment property is the income obtained from tenants’ rent. Income return is affected by several factors, including residents’ satisfaction and their loyalty (in renewing their lease). The ease with which a landlord can let vacant property also depends upon their reputation, the desirability of the neighbourhood, the rental terms and the properties themselves.
This paper analyses almost 5000 interviews with PRS tenants in the UK, conducted over a four-year period, to investigate determinants of resident satisfaction, loyalty (lease renewal) and willingness to recommend their landlord. Statistical analysis is performed using respondents’ ratings of satisfaction with many aspects of their occupancy as explanatory variables. Comparisons are made between interviewees who renew their lease and those who do not renew.  
The research finds that “ease of doing business” with their landlord is a strong predictor of residents’ satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Other key indicators for lease renewal include relationship management, rent collection and value for money. Tenants’ willingness to recommend their landlord depends mainly on their relationship with their landlord, how the landlord compares with tenants’ previous landlords, and the property management service they receive.
This research should help to improve the landlord – tenant relationship in the Private Rented Sector",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Conference abstract/presentation slides

Conventional planning theory tends to assume a logical, rational and linear decision-making process, which bears little relationship to reality. This book aims to shed some light on that reality. The King’s Cross scheme is one of the largest and most complex developments taking place in Britain today. The planning negotiations, which took six years, were probably some of the most exhaustive debates around a development ever. A report of over 600 pages of technical information was eventually presented to the committee, and after two evenings and ten hours of presentations and debate, the committee approved the scheme by just two votes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book

The varied contributions take the form of short stories, illustrated essays, personal reflections and accounts of walks both real and fictional. While artist and RCA tutor Rut Blees Luxemburg and philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy recount a nocturnal journey from Shoreditch to the City of London; architect Peter St John of the practice Caruso St John offers a detailed and personal reflection on the Holloway Road; and architect and author Douglas Murphy examines what he calls London’s ‘more politically charged locations’ in his account of a solitary walk through an area of South London.

At these events, new Company leaders symbolically received corporate endorsement by participating in investiture ceremonies in front of an elite group of Company members and their selected guests. Though all in attendance enjoyed lavish spreads of food and drink, each table received varying, carefully apportioned dishes designed to ensure honour and city hierarchies were upheld.
As a compilation of incredibly detailed accounts for many consecutive years of corporate dining, the Drapers’ Company Dinner Book is extraordinary. It records the organisation of the Company’s dinners and the supply of items of food and drink, as well as the names of guests in the hall and employees in the kitchen. Food gifts sent out after the dinner are recalled comprehensively (which on one occasion consisted of 162 venison pasties). During the period covered by the Dinner Book, new trading corporations and accelerated city growth began to undermine the economic powerbase of London guilds such as the Drapers. Dinner records indicate that the City companies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries recognised the potential of their annual Election Dinners to reinforce the antiquity of corporate authority, inferring a mythical past as a means of legitimizing their stake in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,RPS,Book
