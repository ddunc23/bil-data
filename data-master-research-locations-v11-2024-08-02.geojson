It is plausible that these trends are contributing to regional accessibility inequalities, though quantitative research testing this link is limited. This paper examines differences in employment accessibility between Standard Occupational Classification groups in the London Metropolitan Region for 2011 for car, transit, bus only and walking modes. Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006\u20132016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits. Lower income groups are exposed to rent increases, though this is offset by social housing, which remains the most prevalent tenure in Inner London for low income classes.", "Partners": "1.

The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010\u20132050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.", "Partners": "J.

Built in the 1950s to supply landmark social housing project Churchill Gardens, the district heating system sent heat from nearby Battersea power station into the radiators of the housing estate. The network is a rare example in the United Kingdom, where, unlike other European states, district heating did not become widespread. Today the heating system supplies more than 3,000 homes in the London Borough of Westminster, having survived the closure of the power station and the privatization of the housing estate it supplies. Therefore, this article argues, the neighborhood can be understood as a heterotopia, a site of an alternative sociotechnical order. This concept is used to understand the layers of economic, political, and technological rationalities that have supported PDHU and to question how it has survived radical changes in housing and energy policy in the United Kingdom. This lens allows us to see the tension between the urban planning and engineering perspective, which celebrates this system as a future-oriented \u201cexperiment,\u201d and the reality of managing and using the system on the estate.

In the context of the global financial crisis, austerity and uneven growth, national, sub-national and local state actors are being compelled to adopt the increasingly speculative activities of urban entrepreneurialism to attract new capital, develop \u2018innovative\u2019 financial instruments and models, and establish new or reform existing institutional arrangements for urban infrastructure governance. Amidst concerns about the claimed \u2018ungovernability\u2019 of \u2018global\u2019 cities and city-regions, governing urban infrastructure funding and financing has become an acute issue. Infrastructure renewal and development are interpreted as integral to urban growth, especially to underpin the size and scale of large cities and their significant contributions within national economies. Yet, overcoming fragmented local jurisdictions to improve the governance and economic, social and environmental development of major metropolitan areas remains a challenge. The complex, and sometimes conflicting and contested inter-relationships at stake raise important questions about the role of the state in wrestling with entrepreneurial and managerialist governance imperatives. City and government actors are simultaneously engaging with financial actors, the financialisation of the built environment, the enduring and integral position of the state in infrastructure given its particular characteristics, the transformation of infrastructure from a public good into an asset class through the agency of private and state interests, and what relationships, if any, exist between \u2018effective\u2019 urban governance systems and improved economic performance.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Think tank and IGO ", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)", "Funder 2": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "REF 2021", "Output type": "", "Title": "Governing the \u2018ungovernable\u2019?

They can be hypnotic to look at, but fractals are more than just pretty pictures. Their geometry can describe a plethora of structures, from the branching of blood vessels and brain cells to the shapes of rivers and coastlines. Roberto Murcio and collegues at University College London, UK, now demonstrate how London\u2019s fractal network of streets has changed from being multifractal, scaling spatially according to multiple rules, to monofractal, with a single scaling rule.\n\nThe researchers analyzed nine digitized maps of London from 1786 to 2010 using a statistical approach that estimates the number of street intersections within the city. They found that from 1786 to 1920 the city was multifractal, that is, it had a heterogeneous distribution of street intersections with just as many areas having a lot as having only a few. After 1920, the network gradually lost its multifractality, and by 2010 it had become nearly monofractal with a homogeneous distribution dominated by regions with multiple intersections. The authors argue that the loss of multifractality was caused by the \u201cgreen belt\u201d of countryside around the city, which was introduced in the mid-1950s to contain urban sprawl. This led to the network only being able to expand by filling in the space delimited by the belt. While it\u2019s unclear whether a monofractal city is functionally better than a multifractal one, or vice versa, these findings provide a step towards understanding the consequences of urban-growth policies on the morphology of modern cities.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "REF 2021", "Output type": "", "Title": "Multifractal to monofractal evolution of the London street network"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "39b7fa53170580225c0cfa8011053145", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Classifying metro station areas in Greater London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2019", "Link": "https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.062130", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.102485", "Authors": "Yuerong Zhang (The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London (51.5268702,-0.1298614))\n\nStephen Marshalla(Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (51.521981,-0.136035)\n\nEd Manleyb (Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (51.521981,-0.136035)", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit (51.524936,-0.130021)", "Abstract": "Centralisation of activities and developments around metro station areas is a key transit-oriented development (TOD) policy to encourage more public transport travel through providing maximum access to passengers, thereby enhancing economic efficiency, health, well-being and social inclusion. The node-place-design model is an analytical approach, which investigates the interaction between land use, transportation and the walking friendliness around station areas. Nevertheless, current research focuses on the role station areas plays at the local scale, and little consideration is given to the strategic network (system) level. In this research, we combine a strategic network indicator (criticality) with the node-place-design model to gain deeper insights into London metro station areas in terms of their transit-oriented-development at both local and system levels. Our research has three principal findings: first, most of station areas in Greater London show balanced situations between transport and land use development, except for some stations with a non-walking friendly environment such as Victoria station. Second, the two-tier approach finds that the system criticality of each station area can vary substantially even within the same cluster grouped by the original node- place-design model. Therefore, identifying station groups with relatively high network criticality and relatively low node-place-design score is of potential value. The promising transport connection and less-developed conditions of those station areas could help policymakers locate an intensification- diversification TOD group. Conversely, locations with high node-place-design values but low criticality could point to stations suitable for network expansion (new lines or interchanges). Third, the result reconfirms the value of introducing the third dimension \u2013 design \u2013 into the TOD evaluation of stations at the local scale. The relatively low correlation between node and design value is consistent with previous findings that a transport service-intensive and functionally diverse metro station area does not necessarily produce an accessible friendly walking environment.

Citizen participation rates are usually low, implying that they may feel this way too. There are two good reasons for this feeling: On the one hand, public consultation often only occurs when it is a mandatory exercise required by government for development approval; on the other, when public consultation occurs it is after much time and effort has been invested by professionals to develop a scheme therefore change is made reluctantly or not at all. These factors create a reactionary and adversarial atmosphere during consultation. These structural limitations mean that there is no time to find alignment of interests between project developers and the public, or to develop trust and collaborations. This article explores how codesign games as a form of public participation can be done at an early stage of project development to contribute to finding alignment of interests and collaborations between project developers and different public interests. The empirical case study is focussed on the possibilities for the retrofit of sustainable sanitation systems in London. Three future sanitation systems were developed by 14 workshop participants. They demonstrate new alignments of interests, from methods of collection and treatment, to new economies of reuse and production.

This process of financialisation, it is claimed, is driven by the needs of developers and investors, who are focused on maximising returns and limiting their social and economic liabilities. Planning agencies and traditional territory-based arrangements are viewed with increasing suspicion, as standing in the way of investment and acting as a brake on much needed house-building and regeneration. However, in this paper, drawing on detailed research with investors and developers in London, we argue that there needs to be a stronger focus in academic and policy writing on the multiple, variegated, and diverse calculations and framings that private sector actors take when making investment decisions. Too often their perspectives are caricatured and/or over-simplified. We show that perspectives and imaginations of planning and regulation are more complex and that many firms have realised that market success results from becoming more deeply embedded in the local political, social, and regulatory environments in which they are investing. A greater understanding of these multiple forms of calculation, in turn, opens up opportunities for the maintenance and/or implementation of more effective forms of territorially-based soft and hard regulation.

Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nat- ure of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demon- strate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning \u2013 being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research.", "Partners": "Addison Lee Limited\n", "Partnership Location - In London": "51.4161376953125,-0.2117673009634018\n", "Partnership": "Data support", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Data Support ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)", "Funder 2": "Transport for London (TfL)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "REF 2021", "Output type": "", "Title": "Shortest path or anchor-based route choice: a large-scale empirical analysis of minicab routing in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.098451, 51.513787], [-0.007198, 51.483587]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "c84df627c179a2e6761da0066b74a307", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Economic Institutions of Construction after the Great Fire", "Project Location - In London": "St Paul's Cathedral (51.5137871,-0.0984506) \n\nGreenwich Hospital (51.483587,-0.007198) ", "Date": "2018", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10074847/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1017/eso.2018.26", "Authors": "Judy Z Stephenson", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "Abstract": "This article contributes to literature on the role of \u201cfirms\u201d in the early modern English economy by exploring contracts for works between the Crown, the City of London, and large construction firms that built the Greenwich Hospital, City churches, and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral from 1670 to 1712.

The analysis draws on Latour\u2019s writings on modes of politicisation to examine the processes and practices that shape contemporary urban governance. It uses the example of diversity planning to examine the \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of urban politics. It shows that on the one hand diversity is represented in pragmatic, consensual, and celebratory terms. Under prevailing conditions of contemporary global capitalism, the \u2018what\u2019 of diversity has been politicised into an agenda for labour market-building and the attraction of \u2018talented\u2019 individuals and foreign investment. However, at the same time this celebratory rhetoric represents part of a wider effort to deflect political attention away from the socially and economically divisive impacts of global models of economic growth and physical development. There is little discussion of the ways in which planning frameworks, the \u2018how\u2019 of diversity policy, are helping to generate new separations in and beyond the city. Moreover, despite claiming that policy is pragmatic and non-ideological, the paper shows how diversity narratives have become an integral part of broader political projects to orientate the city\u2019s economy towards the needs of a relatively small cluster of powerful economic sectors. The paper concludes with reflections on the recent impacts of the vote for Brexit and the election of an openly Muslim London Mayor.

Cities are identified as having a critical role in generating and equitably distributing prosperity on these terms. Reframing prosperity in this way opens up space for new forms of dialogue about what it means for people everywhere to prosper, asking how material wealth and other forms of value, equity and fairness, and the needs of humans and non-humans are differentially understood and acted on.

This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made.

This research aims to comprehend the role of inner-city canals, formed as branches of shipping canals, in the spatial accessibility and functional structure of two contemporary urban systems: London and Amsterdam. Both cities are major post-industrial hubs in Europe and their spatial development and socioeconomic conditions have been greatly influenced by waterways. While the canal network in Amsterdam was planned alongside street layout planning in the early 17th century, serving commercial purposes, canals were integrated into London\u2019s pre-existing urban form mainly for transportation in the 19th century. The current situation in these cities is impacted by this disparity in three ways: (a) the potential use of canals in the urban transportation system; (b) the spatial accessibility of street networks; and (c) the correlations between street accessibility and land use patterns in canal neighbourhoods. The research employs analytical methods of space syntax, geographic information systems, and statistical techniques to create and apply integrated urban models, incorporating spatial network measures, retail density, and functional diversity for street segments, to compare various urban conditions. The research reveals the crucial finding that the incorporation of canals into the street system leads to a substantial increase in the mean values of street network accessibility in Amsterdam. Additionally, the study highlights the vital contribution of diagonal streets linked with canal networks towards retail density in this city. In contrast, the accessibility measures and spatial patterns of urban functions in London are predominantly influenced by proximity to canals.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "The Spatio-Functional Role of Navigable Urban Canals in the City: Cases From London and Amsterdam"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "2468903a143433d7281ac642afade208", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Exoadaptivity of Buildings", "Project Location - In London": "London ", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10162727/#:~:text=Using%20unstructured%20data%20from%20the,of%20buildings%20in%20London%20varied.", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.34658/9788367934039.6", "Authors": "Bolton Liam Thomas", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Adapting cities is a method of addressing global warming and rising sea levels.

The assessments in many cases do not include the overall carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of different regeneration scenarios. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the methodology used to calculate the environmental impacts over the lifecycle of buildings. The current practice of building LCA is regularly conducted less effectively, and the uncertainties such as the limited scope of the framework and the variable system boundaries can produce considerably contrasting outcomes which can also be interpreted subjectively. This paper aims to explore a participatory approach to conducting LCA for options appraisal of estate regeneration schemes. The study employs a mixed methods design consisting of primary and secondary data collection and rapid ethnographic observations. The research includes a case study of a Housing Estate in London under threat of demolition. The community\u2019s refurbishment and extension proposal has been developed through knowledge mobility and co-design workshops with the members of the community and University College London (UCL) design team, who are the stakeholders involved in conducting the participatory LCA. LCA of different regeneration and redevelopment scenarios have been explored. The results of the research provide convincing evidence in favour of the refurbishment scenarios over the redevelopment scenario. The findings can make a case for a participatory assessment framework for the evaluation of estate regeneration schemes and highlight the necessity of including other aspects beyond CO2 emissions in the assessment criteria.

An effective monitoring tool that allows us to track the level of change is vital for controlling viral transmission, predicting travel and activity demand and, in the long term, for economic recovery. In this paper, we propose a set of Twitter mobility indices to explore and visualise changes in people\u2019s travel and activity patterns, demonstrated through a case study of London. We collected over 2.3 million geotagged tweets in the Great London Area (GLA) from Jan 2019 \u2013Feb 2021. From these, we extracted daily trips, origin-destination matrices, and spatial networks. Mobility indices were computed based on these, with the year 2019 as a pre-Covid baseline. We found that in London, (1) People are making fewer but longer trips since March 2020. (2) In 2020, travellers showed comparatively reduced interest in central and sub-central activity locations compared to those in outer areas, whereas, in 2021, there is a sign of a return to the old norm. (3) Contrary to some relevant literature on mobility and virus transmission, we found a poor spatial relationship at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level between reported COVID-19 cases and Twitter mobility. It indicated that daily trips detected from geotweets and their most likely associated social, exercise and commercial activities are not critical causes for disease transmission in London. Aware of the data limitations, we also discuss the representativeness of Twitter mobility by comparing our proposed measures to more established mobility indices. Overall, we conclude that mobility patterns obtained from geo-tweets are valuable for continuously monitoring urban changes at a fine spatiotemporal scale.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Technology and Computation ", "Funder 1": "European Union\u00a0", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Twitter mobility dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case study of London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "8748b0bc97878fae5c79e266607290f6", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Challenges to implementing circular development", "Project Location - In London": "Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (51.5465134, -0.016452)\n\nBrixton (51.4626473, -0.114779)", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10153562/1/Challenges%20to%20implementing%20circular%20development%20lessons%20from%20London.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1080/19463138.2022.2103822", "Authors": "Jo WIlliams", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Circular development creates more resource efficient, adaptive, and ecologically healthy cities.

Several studies have been carried out to assess the (negative) impacts of noise on annoyance, particularly whilst working from home (WFH). The present study takes a step further by (1) investigating the positive and negative impacts of the \u201cactual\u201d acoustic environment on a range of activities, i.e., WFH, relaxation, physical, and sexual activities, and (2) identifying the characteristics of an \u201cideal\u201d indoor soundscape. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of verbal descriptions collected from open-ended questions included in a survey administered in January 2021 to 464 respondents living in London, during the COVID-19 lockdown. The range of impacts in the actual scenario varied from no effect on task execution, to disruption, distraction, concern of disturbing others or being heard. Positive impacts included support of concentration, relaxation, motivation, freedom of sound expression, feeling of being connected to the surroundings and comforted by the presence of others, according to mechanisms described in the study. Negative appraisal could trigger coping strategies (e.g., controlling windows, playing music, wearing headphones) and behavioural changes (e.g., lowering the volume of the voice or music, muting oneself during call, changing workout type) that could in turn limit or enhance the freedom of behaviour, affect or foster wellbeing. Negative impacts were most frequently reported on WFH (by 55% of the participants), followed by relaxation activities (40.6%), sexual activities (30.1%), and home workout (20.1%). The ideal soundscape was described as a quiet, well-sound insulated environment, which guarantees access to positive sounds (i.e., natural sounds, music, urban background), thus resulting in privacy, intimacy, and a place where to express themselves without noise-related constraints. The study complements literature findings on housing design directions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing further evidence on the impacts of poor sound insulation at home, the potential benefits of nature-based solutions for positive indoor soundscapes, and opportunities for an activity-based design of domestic environments, inclusive of a broader set of home uses and household compositions.", "Partners": "1.

Temperature and relative humidity data from continuous monitoring during summer 2019 were used to calibrate a building performance simulation model of the care home. Simulation outputs from two bedrooms and two lounges under the current (2019) and future climate (2080s with 90th percentile probability, high-emissions scenario under the UK Climate Projections 2009) were analyzed to evaluate the risk of indoor overheating and humidity discomfort, and to test the effectiveness of adaptation scenarios related to window operation and external shading. Results showed a high risk of exposure to high indoor temperature and low humidity under the current climate, which are expected to worsen in the future. Regarding the effect of passive adaptations, it was found that the highest potential decline in overheating and dry air incidence could be achieved through a combination of secured window opening at night and closing of external shutters during the day; yet this was compromised by an increased risk of humid air. Results further indicated that these strategies are not adequate under a future high-emissions climate scenario, which suggests that care homes need to combine passive and active ventilation to maintain indoor environmental comfort and reduce anticipated cooling demand.", "Partners": "1.

After illustrating the spatial-temporal variations in COVID-19 infection rates across London, this study then particularly aimed to examine the relationships of COVID-19 infection rates with building attributes, including building density, type, age, and use, since previous studies have shown that the built environment plays an important role in public health. Multisource data from national health services and the London Geomni map were processed with GIS techniques and statistically analysed. From March 2020 to April 2022, the infection rate of COVID-19 in London was 3159.28 cases per 10,000 people. The spatial distribution across London was uneven, with a range from 1837.88 to 4391.79 per 10,000 people. During the whole COVID-19 control period, it was revealed that building attributes played a significant role in COVID-19 infection. It was noted that higher building density areas had lower COVID-19 infection rates in London. Moreover, a higher percentage of historic or flat buildings tended to lead to a decrease in infection rates.

In many cities, higher densities demand constructing taller buildings; and therefore, planners need to address their potential impact on the fabric of our cities (both individually and cumulatively) and the political and economic imperatives for cities to build ever taller. However, many existing policies and regulations are outdated and fail to address the nuances of density and its impact on placemaking. This chapter explores these tensions, focusing on the Vauxhall Nine Elms Battersea Opportunity Area in central London. The master plan for the new neighborhood envisages 25,000 new jobs and 20,000 new homes. At the heart of the master plan is a massive increase in density through building tall buildings across the area.

There does seem a possibility that canal networks are associated with the growth of the world\u2019s first cities and their spatial structure. Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the canal structure in shaping the urban form through the city-growing process and its spatio-cultural outcomes in the city environment. It intends to perform a comparative analysis of Amsterdam and London, two diverse structures within their urban configurations and represent a different paradigm of the canal-street structure relationship. The study analyses the main spatial effect of differences in the canal structure overtime on the street configurations of the two cities. Diachronic spatial analysis has been undertaken for three periods for both cities: the 1850s, the 1950s, and the contemporary period. The study uses space syntax techniques as the main methodology; further, the spatial analysis results are geographically projected in GIS, and the statistical analysis is performed on the analysis results of historical maps to measure the physical effects of canal systems on the potential mobility in both cities. The Amsterdam and London analysis results show different examples in terms of street interconnections with canals in the formation of urban structures. While the urban form has been shaped with a top-down planning process in the form of a regular grid structure designed with canals in Amsterdam, the urban form of London is a dominant landbased spatial structure with regard to its movement potentials. Hence, Amsterdam shows an intermediate spatial structure between water- and land-based networks. On the other hand, places are locally and globally more accessible with land-based transportation systems in London.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Spatio-Historical Impact of Urban Canals on the Street Configuration of Cities Diachronic Analysis of Amsterdam and London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.270138, 51.547722], [-0.180391, 51.416131]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "b45124b8661ddd822d417456e4fe0759", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Spatial configuration along two small rivers in London", "Project Location - In London": "Brent (51.54772190852336,-0.27013783508091915)\nWandle River (51.41613050267796,-0.18039055753151567)", "Date": "", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10163408/1/403vanegas2.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Cristin Vanegas\nKayvan Karimi", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Increasing urbanisation puts more pressure on urban river banks in terms of their use as recreational areas as well as their potential for development. Usually, interventions on rivers and riversides are focused on improving their ecological and hydrological aspects. However, to better define objectives for interventions and conservation of urban rivers we need a better understanding of how cities have shaped around rivers and the relationship between these elements and the whole city system. This paper argues that the current interaction between small rivers, urban form and socio-economic outcomes can be investigated through the analysis of the spatial network and land use patterns surrounding them. Using a statistical comparison of the spatial network, land use, demographic data and movement along with an assessment of historic maps, this study analysed the areas surrounding two small London rivers as well as four case studies. The study of the river corridors suggests that their urban form and function are strongly shaped by the connections with the city centre and historical land uses. At the same time, river areas are spatially segregated in comparison with their surrounding areas and they are crossed by routes that are important at city scale while local scale connections are more limited. In addition, the study found that spaces that were better utilised on riversides have a relationship with local centralities in their urban context providing more potential benefits for their communities. A better understanding of the characteristics of river areas and their relationship with the urban environment, particularly the level of accessibility of these natural areas, is relevant to improve policymaking and design interventions that can foster a better relationship between natural resources and the city.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "River corridors.

This paper examines such developments in London to understand how urban food is governed; and, what has been disruptive and how disruption in access to food has been governed during COVID-19. To do so, it draws on policy analysis, case study research and interview data. The paper finds disconnection between the national and metropolitan level and fragmentation between the metropolitan and municipal of urban food governance; with food security being addressed via people-focused approaches which are generously complemented by third sector and community-led initiatives. It also finds that food disruption in London during COVID-19 is defined by the emergence of novel community-led and place-based organisations and policies, especially at the municipal level, which challenge existing food governance structures \u2013 the Hackney Food Network and Food Transition Plans being such examples.

As generators of governance innovation and indicators of the future city in each urban context, large-scale development projects have been interpreted within frameworks of \u201cvariegations\u201d of wider circulating processes, such as neoliberalisation or financialisation. However, such projects often entail significant state support and investment, are strongly linked to a wide variety of transnational investors and developers and are frequently highly contested in their local environments. Thus, each project comes to fruition in a distinctive regulatory context, often as an exception to the norm, and each emerges through complex interactions over a long period of time amongst an array of actors. We therefore seek to broaden the discussion from an analytical focus on variegated globalised processes to consider three large-scale urban development projects (in Shanghai, Johannesburg and London) as distinctive (transcalar) territorialisations. Using an innovative comparative approach we outline the grounds for a systematic analytical conversation across mega-urban development projects in very different contexts. Initially, comparability rests on the shared features of large-scale developments \u2013 that they are multi-jurisdictional, involve long time scales, and bring significant financing challenges. Comparing three development projects we are able to interrogate, rather than take for granted, how wider processes, circulating practices, transcalar actors, and territorial regulatory formations composed specific urban outcomes in each case.

On weekdays, when outdoor air pollution concentrations peak in the morning and in the late afternoon, people are usually either in non-domestic premises or on their way to/from non-domestic premises. Therefore, establishing the distributions of indoor air pollutant concentrations in non-domestic environments is essential to model human exposure to hazardous air pollution, especially for vulnerable populations, such as schoolchildren or patients in hospitals. In the Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure Model of the US Environmental Protection Agency, microenvironment pollutant concentrations are determined by outdoor pollutant concentrations, penetration of outdoor air indoors, proximity of the microenvironment to the outdoor pollutant emission source, and emission sources within microenvironments. Penetration of outdoor air to indoors is related to building characteristics, such as fabric air tightness and ventilation control, which can be affected by energy efficiency retrofits. The aim of this study is to predict the air penetration rate for London's school buildings (nursery, primary and secondary schools) and enhance our understanding of how energy efficiency improvements will impact indoor air quality modelling so as to prevent potential harmful exposure and improve existing retrofit techniques. The baseline statistics of building physics for school environments in London were aggregated from the building typologies and room uses from 3DStock Model to analyse the effect of built configurations on building ventilation and air tightness. The simulation results show that air change rates due to natural ventilation is low in Post-1980 school buildings, which means recently built or retrofitted buildings that are more airtight and energy efficient need to carefully maintain purpose provided ventilation to ensure adequate air exchange.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Simulating Ventilation for Indoor Air Quality of Non-domestic Environments in London Schools: A Building-based Bottom-up Approach"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "32fddfaa5da10ac2511d9284f84a439a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Analysis and Modelling of the Multilevel Transport Network", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10156600/1/Chen_Karimi_ISUF_2021_Analysis_and_modelling_of_the_multilevel_transport.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.17868/strath.00080473 ", "Authors": "Po Nien Chen\nDr Kayvan Karimi", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Transport development has become more and more important among all aspects of urban development in recent years. To accommodate the rising demand for daily travel and commutes, the public transport system, especially the rail system, is considered the better solution for sustainable mobility, instead of the road system for vehicles. Studies in urban morphology usually focus on the model of urban form without concerning the multi-dimensional network of public transport, whereas transport planning and engineering emphasise the capacity and travel demand within the road network, which disregards the spatial effect of the urban form. This research aims to bridge the gap between these two disciplines by developing an Integrated Urban Model (IUM), which combined various layers of urban information and dataset, including spatial network, land use and census. It seeks to identify the complex interrelationship between urban form networks and the socio-economic community by the synthetic analysis of the IUM.

In addition, this study applied space syntax theory and methodology as the primary approach to reveal the potential flow and movement pattern of the multilevel multimodal network. The result indicated that the multilevel network model with space syntax accessibility measurements could provide an interpretative overview of spatial distribution in both global and local scales.

In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering six years (2015\u20132020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ)\u2014a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by about 1.0 \u2218C\u20131.5 \u2218C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 \u00b1 0.96 \u2218C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to 1.57 \u2218C, on average and negatively by down to \u22121.21 \u2218C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit.

By developing commodified real estate and monetising rising land values, they promise to deliver well-designed housing, generate long-term fiscal rents, and secure local state autonomy.

Yet, despite the proliferation of studies investigating accessibility and equity from the perspective of the younger generation, only modest progress has been made in embedding a temporal perspective and targeting health services for older adults. Currently, the number of people over 60s in London is growing rapidly and is projected to increase to approximately two million by 2035. Aims: This research aims to examine walking accessibility to General Practitioners (GPs) for older people in Greater London, with a particular focus from a temporal perspective. Methods: Three different datasets were used for this study, namely: GP services data and data on GP Opening Times data from NHS Choices; the London Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) atlas; and the road network derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study uses on the cumulative method to calculate accessibility to GPs \u2013 and applies the vertical equity index to measure temporal equity. Results: Our results show that opening times have a significant impact on accessibility to health services for older people in London. Overall accessibility peaked at midday when 15.88% of areas have a low degree of accessibility. Additionally, our study classifies local authorities into five groups based on their performance on accessibility and vertical equity measurements. We found several districts with inadequate and unequal accessibility that can be identified as vulnerable areas. Conclusions: Gaining insights into the temporal variations in accessibility to GPs represents a key step towards providing optimal services. Our findings can be used to provide an evidence-based reference for transport planners and policymakers to promote age-friendly development and planning.", "Partners": "Menggiu Cao", "Partnership Location - In London": "School of Architecture and Cities, University of Westminster, United Kingdom (51.522023,-0.154599)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "National Social Science Fund of China (NSSFC)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Exploring the temporal variations in accessibility to health services for older adults: A case study in Greater London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[0.114849, 51.498933]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "e837f2570a1e4b7ad7290c65b0c23826", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Urban Green Space Usage through Systems Thinking", "Project Location - In London": "Thamesmead (51.4989335,0.1148486)", "Date": "2023", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10144462/1/Salvia_sustainability-14-02575-v4.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.3390/su14052575 ", "Authors": "Giuseppe Salvia\nIrene Pluchinotta\nIonna Tsoulou\nGemma Moore\nNici Zimmermann ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "Urban green spaces provide environmental, economic, societal and health benefits to cities.

Previous research has identified factors influencing the use of urban green space, more often with a focus on the \u2018quality\u2019 and physical features of the space, rather than on the broader social factors. This study aims to unpack the complexity of factors that influence the use of urban green space through the application of Systems Thinking. A qualitative mixed-method approach integrating System Dynamics with rapid ethnography was adopted to elicit the views of local residents in Thamesmead, London. A thematic analysis of interviews was undertaken to systematically map the causal relations between factors, which were compared to wider stakeholders\u2019 views. Our findings highlight the relevance of dynamics and social influences on the use of green space, which include social interactions and stewardship, health conditions, availability of services and amenities. These are factors that are underexplored in the literature and, sometimes, overlooked in urban green space policy by decision-makers. We infer that attendance of urban green spaces requires time, which may be occupied in other practices determined by local conditions and needs. Expanding the spatial and temporal boundaries of investigation, wider than debates on \u2018quality\u2019, should, in our view, increase the chances of identifying critical influences and foster an increased use of green space.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Think tank", "Policy source subcategory": "New Economics Foundation", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Wellcome Trust\u00a0", "Funder 2": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Understanding Urban Green Space Usage through Systems Thinking: A Case Study in Thamesmead, London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "9f5f57dd5f303959aaa438078ecb56d8", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Living with air-conditioning", "Project Location - In London": "London ", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10143498/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.5334/bc.147", "Authors": "Niamh Murtagh\nSulafa Badi\nYaling Shi \nShen Wei \nWei Yu", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Sulafa Badi\nFaculty of Business & Law, The British University in Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (25.12538288856362, 55.41159508957058)\n\nYaling Shi\nFaculty of Architecture and Urban Planning, Chongqing University, Shapingba District, Chongqing, China, 400038 (29.568249612556908, 106.46132198040108)\n\nWei Yu\nDepartment of Building Environment and Equipment Engineering, Chongqing University, , Chongqing University, Shapingba District, Chongqing, China, 400038 (29.56770832843931, 106.4604636735015)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "Abstract": "Extreme heat is a likely consequence of global warming, leading to increased mortality and reduced wellbeing.

AC enabled indoor work to proceed, but a restricted indoor life meant less exercise, less social interaction and health issues. Participants had over-adapted, not to heat but to cold indoor temperatures, which were uncomfortable for many. In London, AC was not yet used, but the purchase of AC was being contemplated. The London participants showed a range of behavioural adaptations to heat. To reduce dependence on AC, regulations and behaviour change interventions regarding AC settings should focus on acclimatisation to heat. Changes in societal patterns, such as workhours, and behavioural adaptations, such as informed use of shading, can help mitigate heat.

There is also evidence on the role played by blue and green space in improving physical and mental health, reducing the burden on the health care service. Yet from an urban planning and development view, natural capital may be considered a nice to have, but not essential element of urban design; taking up valuable space which could otherwise be used for traditional built environment uses. While urban natural capital is largely recognised as a positive element, its benefits are difficult to measure both in space and time, making its inclusion in urban (re)development difficult to justify. Here, using a London case study and information provided by key stakeholders, we present a system dynamics (SD) modelling framework to assess the natural capital performance of development and aid design evaluation. A headline indicator: Natural Space Performance, is used to evaluate the capacity of natural space to provide ecosystem services, providing a semi-quantitative measure of system wide impacts of change within a combined natural, built and social system. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to explore how combined or individual changes in development design can affect natural capital and the provision of ecosystem services, for example, biodiversity or flood risk. By evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services over time, greater justification for their inclusion in planning and development can be derived, providing support for increased blue and green space within cities, improving urban sustainability and enhancing quality of life.

Alternative statistical meta-models were developed with both explanatory and predictive purposes, correlating the simulation input with the overheating risk predictions expressed according to multiple metrics. Results from multiple linear regression analysis show that while all factors considered are relevant towards determining the propensity to overheating, window opening and natural ventilation capacity are by far the strongest predictors among those considered.

Perceived affective quality of indoor soundscapes has been assessed in the survey through a previously developed model, as the combination of two perceptual dimensions, one related to comfort (a comfortable \u2013 annoying continuum) and the other to content (a full of content \u2013 empty continuum). Part I of the study reported on differences in comfort, content, and soundscape appropriateness based on the activity performed at home during the lockdown, i.e. working from home (WFH) and relaxation. Moreover, associations between soundscape dimensions and psychological well-being have been highlighted. Part II of the study deals with the exploration of the influences of several acoustical, building, urban and person-related factors on soundscape dimensions and well-being. A mixed-method approach has been adopted by combining multivariate regression of questionnaire scores with the qualitative analysis of spontaneous descriptions given by respondents. Results showed that several sound sources, urban features, housing characteristics, working modes and demographic factors can influence (positively and negatively) soundscape dimensions differently depending on the task at hand. Notably, the perceived dominance of neighbours\u2019 noises during relaxation, moderated by noise sensitivity, and the number of people at home were common factors negatively affecting both comfort and well-being, that partially explained the association between comfortable indoor soundscapes and better mental health. The discussion points out the importance of considering the different impacts that acoustical factors (e.g. sound typology), building (e.g., house size), urban (e.g., availability of a quiet side), situational (e.g., number of people at home), and person-related factors (e.g., noise sensitivity) can provide on building occupants depending on the specific activity people are engaged with at home and the opportunities to foster people\u2019s well-being through building, urban and acoustic design.", "Partners": "Adult participants via Prolific participant pool", "Partnership Location - In London": "London", "Partnership": "Data / questionnaire / method", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)", "Funder 2": "European Research Council (ERC)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Indoor soundscapes at home during the COVID-19 lockdown in London \u2013 Part II: A structural equation model for comfort, content, and well-being"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.123689, 51.507497]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "86ff9136425daf046500989b1660cf75", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Taxi drivers' cognitive map of London", "Project Location - In London": "Charing Cross (51.5074975,-0.1236888)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10141233/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1002/hipo.23395", "Authors": "Eva Griesbauer \nEd Manley \nJan Malte Wiener\nHugo J Spiers ", "London Authors": "Eva Griesbauer and Hugo J Spiers \nDepartment of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, University College London, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP (51.52415840435603, -0.12892395769084228)\n\nEd Manley\nThe Alan Turing Institute, British Library, 96 Euston Rd., London NW1 2DB (51.52942966641486, -0.1275945172096855)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Jan Malte Wiener\nDepartment of Psychology, Ageing and Dementia Research Centre, Bournemouth University, Fern Barrow, Poole BH12 5BB (50.74359164117267, -1.8984133037402662)\n\nEd Manley\nSchool of Geography, University of Leeds, Seminary St, Woodhouse, Leeds LS2 9JT (53.80636741831759, -1.555455581290279)", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "Licensed London taxi drivers have been found to show changes in the gray matter density of their hippocampus over the course of training and decades of navigation in London (UK).

Recent models of hierarchical route planning use boundaries to plan efficiently first across regions and then within regions. However, it remains unclear which structures (e.g. parks, rivers, major streets, etc.) will form salient boundaries in real-world cities. This study tested licensed London taxi drivers, who are unique in their ability to navigate London flexibly without physical navigation aids. They were asked to indicate streets they considered as boundaries for London districts or dividing areas. It was found that agreement on boundary streets varied considerably, from some boundaries providing almost no consensus to some boundaries consistently noted as boundaries. Examining the properties of the streets revealed that a key factor in the consistent boundaries was the near rectilinear nature of the designated region (e.g. Mayfair and Soho) and the distinctiveness of parks (e.g. Regent's Park). Surprisingly, the River Thames was not consistently considered as a boundary. These findings provide insight into types of environmental features that lead to the perception of explicit boundaries in large-scale urban space. Because route planning models assume that boundaries are used to segregate the space for efficient planning, these results help make predictions of the likely planning demands of different routes in such complex large-scale street networks. Such predictions could be used to highlight information used for navigation guidance applications to enable more efficient hierarchical planning and learning of large-scale environments.", "Partners": "Jeremy Morley", "Partnership Location - In London": "\nOrdnance Survey \n50.938114,-1.470628", "Partnership": "Research Support and co-authorship", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Data Support ", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "Ordnance Survey\u00a0", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "What determines a boundary for navigating a complex street network: evidence from London taxi drivers"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "7c8f20245074bcf44b8e3fe802f03cc9", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Documenting the \u2018soft spaces\u2019 of London planning", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10126839/1/Documenting%20the%20soft%20spaces%20of%20London%20planning%20Opportunity%20Areas%20as%20institutional%20fix%20in%20a%20growth%20oriented%20city.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2021.1902976", "Authors": "Jessica Ferm\nSonia Freire Trigo\nNiamh Moore-Cherry ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Niamh Moore-Cherry\nSchool of Geography and Earth Institute, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland (53.309867800004696, -6.221546786469968)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "The concentration of economic growth into large metropolises is widely documented across Europe.

This paper examines the current and future risk of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings. Continuous monitoring of outdoor and indoor temperature in bedrooms, communal areas and offices in summer 2019 helped to establish the prevalence and intensity of overheating. Dynamic thermal simulation (EnergyPlusV8.9) of the two care settings assessed the potential for avoiding active cooling in future climate using passive solutions. In both care settings, indoor temperatures were observed to exceed 30 \u00b0C during daytime hours, significantly higher than the recommended 26 \u00b0C threshold of Public Health England. Although severity of overheating was lower in the older building, overheating was found to be prevalent and prolonged across both care settings with bedroom temperatures higher than lounges especially at night. Thermal simulation analysis showed that, with regards to temperature reduction and cooling load, nighttime ventilation was the single most effective passive solution for both buildings for the current climate, while a combination of night ventilation, external shading and high-albedo external walls was the most effective package solution. By the 2080s, air-conditioning was the most effective solution for reducing temperature, but also had the highest cooling load, highlighting the importance of balancing passive with active measures to improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling loads.", "Partners": "Paul Wilkinson ", "Partnership Location - In London": "Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK\n(51.520925,-0.130687)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Government and think tank", "Policy source subcategory": "Legislative Research and University affiliated ", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "Funder 2": "DesignBuilder Software Ltd", "Funder 3": "Innovate UK\u00a0", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Monitoring and modelling the risk of summertime overheating and passive solutions to avoid active cooling in London care homes"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.305195, 51.512655], [-0.21838, 51.57676], [-0.224429, 51.493042]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "db503b6b57975ed9b8dad8df577c264a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Financing urban development", "Project Location - In London": "Ealing (51.5126553,-0.3051952)\n\nBrent (51.5767595,-0.2183801)\n\nHammersmith and Fulham (51.4930419921875,-0.2244289070367813)", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10109248/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1016/j.progress.2020.100513", "Authors": "Jennifer Robinson \nPhilip Harrison\nJie Shen \nFulong Wu ", "London Authors": "Jennifer Robinson\nDepartment of Geography, University College London (51.523919,-0.12895)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Philip Harrison\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand, 1 Jan Smuts Ave, Braamfontein, Johannesburg, 2017, South Africa (-26.192766505762286, 28.031090827875076)\n\nJie Shen\nSchool of Social Development and Public Policy, Fudan University, 220 Handan Rd, Yangpu District, Shanghai, China, 200437 (32.96897254331799, 120.97133517841866)\n", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of \u201cfinancialisation\u201d to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive \u201cbusiness models\u201d, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.", "Partners": "1.

The survey utilized a previously developed model for the assessment of indoor soundscapes to describe the affective responses to the acoustic environments in a perceptual space defined by comfort (i.e. how comfortable or annoying the environment was judged) and content (i.e., how saturated the environment is with events and sounds) dimensions. A mixed-method approach was adopted to reinforce result validity by triangulating data from questionnaires and spontaneous descriptions given by participants. In this first part of the study, the main objectives were: (1) evaluating differences in soundscape evaluation, in terms of comfort and content dimensions, based on the activity performed at home, (2) identifying appropriate conditions for WFH and relaxation, and (3) investigating associations between psychological well-being and indoor soundscapes. The results showed that the environments were perceived as more comfortable and slightly fuller of content when rated in relation to relaxation than for WFH, thus suggesting a stricter evaluation of the acoustic environment in the latter case. As regards the second objective, spaces that were more appropriate for relaxation had high comfort, whereas spaces appropriate for WFH resulted more private and under control, i.e. with high comfort and low content scores. Lastly, better psychological well-being was associated with more comfortable soundscapes, both for WFH (rs = 0.346, p < .0005), and relaxation (rs = 0.353, p < .0005), and with lower content while WFH (rs = \u22120.133, p = .004). The discussion points out the need of considering the implications of changed working patterns to rethink the design of soundscapes in residential buildings, also in relation to potential well-being outcomes that will be further investigated in the Part II of the study.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with research organization(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE)", "Funder 2": "European Research Council (ERC)", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Indoor soundscapes at home during the COVID-19 lockdown in London \u2013 Part I: Associations between the perception of the acoustic environment, occupant\u015b activity and well-being"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.127833, 51.507265]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "a2b3e140fc2506a51e28e17a1cc140d7", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "UCL: an architectural history, 1825\u20131939", "Project Location - In London": "UCL main Campus (51.5072648,-0.1278328)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10138589/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10138589/", "Authors": "Amy Louise Spencer ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "This thesis examines the architectural history of University College London (UCL) from its foundation to 1939. UCL traces its beginnings to 1825, when a group of radical thinkers set about establishing a secular, non-residential metropolitan university. Its first architectural expression was the grand neoclassical building constructed in 1827\u20139 to designs by William Wilkins. Only the central block, portico and dome of Wilkins\u2019s scheme were completed, yet successive wing extensions gradually formed a neoclassical quadrangle in Gower Street. A hospital was built in 1833\u20134, securing space for clinical teaching. UCL was initially denied a charter and precluded from awarding degrees, a complication that was resolved by the creation of the University of London as a separate examining body in 1836. Over the next century, UCL and its hospital expanded in a gradual and piecemeal manner in line with advances in education, technology and healthcare. UCL\u2019s estate became increasingly complex, with a mixture of purpose-built blocks and the adaptation of buildings in the vicinity. A wealth of archival records, along with documentary sources and field investigation, has been used to examine the historic core of UCL\u2019s estate in Bloomsbury. Institutional identity and aspirations are analysed in concert with practical influences on building projects, such as finances and functionality. The matter of identity also arises in the attribution of buildings to specific architects, which points to a tradition of enlisting professors such as Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Thomas Hayter Lewis, Thomas Roger Smith, Frederick Moore Simpson and Albert Richardson. In practice, their work was informed by multiple voices such as committee members, academic staff, external consultants and benefactors.

The overall aim was examining how noise complaints changed during the first stages of the lockdown implementation, during Spring 2020, both locally and at city scale, and how urban factors may have been influencing them. Noise complaint and urban factor datasets from the Government's publicly available data warehouse were used. The results show that during the COVID-19 lockdown the number of noise complaints increased by 48%, compared with the same period during Spring 2019. In terms of noise sources, complaints about construction (36%) and neighbourhood (50%) noise showed significant increases. Urban factors, including housing and demographic factors, played a more significant role than the actual noise exposure to road and rail traffic noise, as derived from the London noise maps. In detail, the change rate of noise complaints was higher in areas with higher unemployment rates, more residents with no qualifications, and lower house price.

However, whereas a number of participatory MCA methods have been devised, the large majority of them seem to have enjoyed limited practical application and there are very few studies examining their effectiveness.

The goal of the paper is to identify both how long it takes projects to go from idea to delivery, the relative time of different stages in the delivery process, and if projects with long timelines see physical or technological changes in their design. This work contributes to two ongoing discussions around the speed of infrastructure delivery, one that argues infrastructure moves too slowly and major efforts are needed to speed delivery and another that argues that good infrastructure thinking requires time to breathe and care should be taken in rushing through the delivery process. Detailed delivery timelines from initial proposal to construction or operation are developed for 26 transportation projects (16 in Toronto and 10 in London) between the years 2000 and 2018. For each project the timelines of inception, approval, planning, procurement, environmental assessment, construction and operational phases are identified and compared. Long informal gestation periods are identified for many projects, particularly for linear projects. In many instances the informal gestation period dwarfs the time projects spent in formal planning.

However, current transit resilience research only focuses on infrastructure resilience, giving little consideration to its interaction with passengers. Moreover, even for transit infrastructure resilience, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing resilience to reflect its scale-sensitive attributes. Therefore, to make cities and transit systems move from a vulnerable state to a more resilient one, this thesis seeks to advance our understanding of transit resilience performance from macro, meso and micro levels, focusing on the interactions between infrastructure and passengers. Additionally, this research is motivated by the need to bridge the theoretical gap between the transport network and complex network science disciplines. This research draws on a multiple-level framework to investigate stations' roles in maintaining London transit resilience at macro, meso and micro levels from a network perspective. At macro level, this research examines the overall transit resilience performance by using percolation modelling and fault tolerance. At meso level, resilience as a sub-network feature is examined by unravelling the travel structure and identifying the stations' roles in maintaining resilience within and beyond metropolitan levels through community detection and Z-P scores. This research evaluates each station\u2019s role in maintaining resilience based on resilience and criticality matrix at micro level. In addition, this research seeks to answer for whom we should build resilience by including the transport equity analysis. In line with the conceptual framework, this research develops an R package1, ResilienceNet, which provides a reproducible and accessible tool to examine transit resilience at multiple levels. Three research findings can be derived from this research. First, the London transit is resilient against random disruption but relatively vulnerable to centrality-based attacks. The conventional network approach would understate or overstate the resilience performance at the macro level. Second, the empirical results justify the necessity to include an evaluation of resilience at the meso level, as the role of stations for ensuring resilience varies differently within and beyond sub-city communities. Third, at the micro-level, this research identifies 25 stations and some vulnerable groups, such as young and low-income groups, which are more likely to be affected by transit disruptions and need more attention. The results derived through analysis could be used to facilitate transport and urban planning at multiple levels, thus moving cities and transit systems from a vulnerable to a more resilient state.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Identifying and Characterising Active Travel Corridors for London in Response to Covid-19 Using Shortest Path and Streetspace Analysis"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[0.079236, 51.536247], [0.029309, 51.530016], [-0.012319, 51.524629], [-0.027289, 51.522975], [-0.003547, 51.541289], [-0.049362, 51.54324]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "d61d8d01fa5d01d76ca762107a7d8af7", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Ethnicity and prosperity in east London", "Project Location - In London": "Barking and Dagenham (51.53624725341797,0.0792360007762909)\nNewham (51.5300157,0.0293091)\nBromley by Bow (51.5246287,-0.0123189)\nTower Hamlets (51.5229753,-0.0272891)\nStratford (51.541289,-0.0035472)\nHackney (51.5432402,-0.0493621)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10130980/7/Ethnicity%20%20Prosperity.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.14324/000.wp.10130980", "Authors": "Efrosini Charalambous\nElisabetta Pietrostefani \nSaffron Woodcraft ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Institute for Global Prosperity (51.523897,-0.137055)", "Abstract": "This working paper explores the London Prosperity Index survey data through an ethnicity lens and provides some preliminary findings concerning on the relation between racial inequality and prosperity.

Concurrent energy efficiency improvements to housing may modify indoor exposures to heat or cold, while population aging may increase susceptibility to temperature-related mortality. We estimate heat and cold mortality and energy consumption in London for typical (non-extreme) future climates, given projected changes in population and housing. Building physics models are used to simulate summertime and wintertime indoor temperatures and space heating energy consumption of London dwellings for \u2018baseline\u2019 (2005-2014) and future (2030s, 2050s) periods using data from the English Housing Survey, historical weather data, and projected future weather data with temperatures representative of \u2018typical\u2019 years. Linking to population projections, we calculate future heat and cold attributable mortality and energy consumption with demolition, construction, and alternative scenarios of energy efficiency retrofit. At current retrofit rates, around 168-174 annual cold-related deaths per million population would typically be avoided by the 2050s, or 261-269 deaths per million under ambitious retrofit rates. Annual heat deaths would typically increase by 1 per million per year under the current retrofit rate, and 12-13 per million under ambitious rates without population adaptation to heat. During typical future summers, an estimated 38-73% of heat-related deaths can be avoided using external shutters on windows, with their effectiveness lower for hotter summers. Despite warmer winters, ambitious retrofit rates are necessary to reduce typical annual energy consumption for heating below baseline levels, assuming no improvement in heating system efficiencies. Concerns over future overheating in energy efficient housing are valid but increases in heat attributable mortality during typical and hot (but not extreme) summers are more than offset by significant reductions in cold mortality and easily mitigated using passive measures. More ambitious retrofit rates are critical to reduce energy consumption and offer co-benefits for reducing cold-related mortality.", "Partners": "Paul Wilkinson", "Partnership Location - In London": "Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK\n(51.520925,-0.130687)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Government", "Policy source subcategory": "The UK Government", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "Wellcome Trust\u00a0", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Projecting the impacts of housing on temperature-related mortality in London during typical future years"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "0252a7f490f52b3643b620ef7c3bcc1b", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Understanding the roles of rail stations", "Project Location - In London": "London Metropolitan Region", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10129011/1/Manuscript.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103110", "Authors": "Yuerong Zhang\nStephen Marshall \nEd Manley", "London Authors": "Ed Manley\nThe Alan Turing Institute, British Library, 96 Euston Rd., London NW1 2DB (51.52942966641486, -0.1275945172096855)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Ed Manley\nSchool of Geography, University of Leeds, Seminary St, Woodhouse, Leeds LS2 9JT (53.80636741831759, -1.555455581290279)", "Department": "", "Abstract": "In strategic transport planning, rail stations play different roles at different scales, particularly in large cities and metropolitan regions, where movement structure shows polycentric patterns.

Drawing on the Transport for London's newly released NUMBAT passenger origin-destination data, we unravel the travel structure and identify the stations' roles through network methods, community detection and Z-P scores. Our research has three results: First, London's passenger movement network can be subdivided into seven communities. The majority of stations within the same communities are geographically localised with few exceptions. Second, stations play distinct roles in handling the patterns of movement at different scales. Typically, there exists a set of stations that are significant for connecting between metropolitan communities, because the disruption of those stations will have a greater impact on overall network efficiency and affect a larger and more diverse group of passengers. Third, a classification of rail stations is developed based on stations' commitment at two scales. This classification allows planners to have a finer level of understanding of the network role of the stations and thus develop and adjust tailored (re)development strategies.", "Partners": "Ed Manley", "Partnership Location - In London": "The Alan Turing Institute, United Kingdom (51.529985,-0.127014)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with research organization(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with research organization(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Understanding the roles of rail stations: Insights from network approaches in the London metropolitan area"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "d96421db9d06e2f64db1e8ccda75ffbc", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Streetspace allocation metrics and street networks", "Project Location - In London": "Central London", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10127358/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10127358 ", "Authors": "Nicolas Andres Ortega Palominos", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "This research investigates streetspace allocation metrics for all streets in London providing quantitative evidence about a key parameter of street design citywide. A new methodology to quantify streetspace allocation is introduced using a geocomputational approach that allows both the processing of high-resolution topographic data over a large geographic extent and enables replicability for other cities. The correlation between streetspace allocation metrics and street network centrality at distinct scales is investigated across different geographic areas. These variables are then examined using cluster analysis to identify a typology of streets based on streetspace allocation and centrality. The results provide the framework for a design scenario study of inner London applying shortest-path analysis under an active travel prioritisation perspective. Streetspace statistics for London confirm the predominance of space allocated for vehicular transport over pedestrian uses. Most streets display standard residential street metrics, coinciding with traditional street classification schemes. Also, this serves to demonstrate quantitatively the spatially efficient organisation of the London street system with few wider distributors and many narrower local streets. In addition, through the combined examination of the streets' allocation and configurational metrics, it is possible to identify a new sub-type of local streets. The spatial arrangement of the streets segments types follows a centre-periphery pattern: wider and higher centrality streets are clustered at the city centre and show relative larger streetspace designated to pedestrians, corresponding with higher levels of estimated activity. On a prescriptive streetspace model of Inner London, the streetspace allocation of critical pathways is modified to illustrate how strategic scale street properties affect and are affected by design scale street parameters. The fine-grain physical metrics analysed here, not only can be useful to tackle a wide range of contemporary street related questions from urban environmental quality to the adoption of new technologies but also offer alternative analytical methods for street research, planning and design.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Technology and Computation ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Rethinking Streets: a study of streetspace allocation metrics and street networks in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.027289, 51.522975]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "eb8c19a522585548523a59a4d38ce66e", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Seasonal variations & the influence of ventilation rates on IAQ", "Project Location - In London": "Tower Hamlets (51.5229753,-0.0272891)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10129257/1/1420326x211017175.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1420326X211017175", "Authors": "Samuel Stamp\nEsfand Burman\nClive Shrubsole\nLia Chatzidiakou\nDejan Mumovic \nMike Davies", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Lia Chatzidiakou\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW (53.32037770501094, 0.18038051222666768)", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "The indoor air quality (IAQ) of five low-energy London apartments has been assessed through the measurement of 16 key pollutants, using continuous and diffusive methods across heating and non-heating seasons. This case study approach aimed to assess the presence of pollutants within low-energy apartments and to better understand the role of ventilation and seasonal variations in indoor air quality. The results indicate strong seasonal variations, driven by increased natural ventilation rates over the summer monitoring period. A combined metric for indoor and outdoor pollutants (Itot) suggests that the IAQ in the winter (Itot = 17.7) is more than twice as bad as that seen in the summer (Itot = 8.6). Formaldehyde concentrations were lower in the non-heating season, indicating increased ventilation rates more than offset increased off-gassing, in contrast to findings in other studies. However, increased summertime ventilation rates were observed to increase the proportion of outdoor pollutants entering the internal environment. This resulted in higher indoor concentrations of NO2 in the summer than the winter, despite significant reductions in outdoor concentrations.

To this end, one-year\u2019s worth of monitored data on indoor and outdoor environment along with occupant use of windows has been used to analyse the impact of lockdown on IAQ and infer probabilistic models of window operation behaviour. Moreover, using on-site CO2 data, monitored occupancy and operation of windows, the team has calibrated a thermal performance model of one of the flats to investigate the implications of alternative ventilation strategies. The results suggest that despite the extended occupancy during lockdown, occupants relied less on natural ventilation, which led to an increase of median CO2 concentration by up to 300 ppm.

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, time\u2013activity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.", "Partners": "Sani Dimitroulopoulou Environmental Hazards and Emergencies Department, Public Health England United Kingdom", "Partnership Location - In London": "(51.5045224, -0.0221204)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with government partner(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Government\nThink Tank ", "Policy source subcategory": "State of California \nIrish Envrionmental Protection Agency \nThe UK Government \nIZA Institute of Labor Economics \nBright Blue Think Tank", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with government partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Systemic inequalities in indoor air pollution exposure in London, UK"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.127833, 51.507265], [-0.2253, 51.5307]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "4fed46080a457bd668fa6a952b9df837", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The summertime overheating in care homes", "Project Location - In London": "Care home PA, West London (51.5072648,-0.1278328)\nCare home VI, London NW10 (51.5307,-0.2253)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10128362/1/01436244211013645.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01436244211013645", "Authors": "Rajat Gupta\nAlastair Howard \nMike Davies \nAnna Mavrogianni\nIoanna Tsoulou \nEleni Oikkonomou \nPaul Wilkinson", "London Authors": "Paul Wilkinson \nPublic Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK\n(51.520925,-0.130687)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Rajat Gupta\nAlastair Howard\nLow Carbon Building Research Group, School of Architecture, Oxford Brookes University, Headington Rd, Headington, Oxford OX3 0BP (51.75506260978898, -1.2242334060592617)", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "This paper brings together objective and subjective data on indoor temperature and thermal comfort to examine the magnitude and perception of summertime overheating in two London-based care homes occupying modern and older buildings.

Improving the energy efficiency of homes is a key objective to help reach this target, and the UK government's Clean Growth Strategy aims to get many homes up to an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Band of C by 2035. The relationship between home energy-efficiency and occupant health and wellbeing remains an area of ongoing research. This paper explores the nexus between home energy efficiency, energy consumption and self-reported health-an indicator of the general health and wellbeing of the population. We focus on Greater London through secondary data analysis. Energy-efficiency ratings and air infiltration rates of dwellings, derived from EPCs, were aggregated and matched to local area self-reported health and energy consumption data obtained from the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) Atlas database. Our regression model indicates that improving the energy efficiency (SAP) rating by 10 points for a typical home may reduce household gas consumption by around 7% (95% CIs: 2%, 14%). Beta regression finds a positive, but not statistically significant association between median SAP rating and the proportion of the population reporting 'good or very good' health when considering all Greater London LSOAs (z score = 0.60, p value = 0.55). A statistically significant positive association is observed however when repeating the analysis for the lowest income quartile LSOAs (z score = 2.03, p value = 0.04).

We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2% of all properties in London, and up to 7% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of \u00a390 price increase per year.

Little is currently understood about the collective transport impacts of such activity in urban centres and to what extent this poses challenges for transport policymakers. The paper provides an international review of market growth in this sector together with insight into key topics associated with its freight delivery operations in urban areas. Using a substantial database of meal deliveries made in London by a major platform provider, this paper quantifies the operational performance of these deliveries and their transport and environmental impacts. On average, 9.6 deliveries were undertaken by a DD daily, with each taking 25 min from pickup to delivery with an average trip length, from restaurant to customer of 2.2 km (1.4 miles) a DD travelling 41.3 km (25.7 miles) in total per day, The analysis of the case study indicates the relative transport inefficiency of these on-demand meal deliveries compared to other forms of urban road freight (with a meal delivered by car being responsible for approximately 1300 times the distance travelled by an articulated HGV operation per tonne delivered). It also highlights the far greater GHG emissions and transport intensity associated with meals deliveries by cars and petrol mopeds compared to bicycles (emitting 5 and 11 times more GHGs per meal delivered than bicycles, respectively). The transport and GHG emissions intensity of these meal deliveries raises important policy issues, especially given therapid growth in the provision of, and demand for, these services internationally, Based on the review and analysis, the paper provides a discussion of the key issues that urban policymakers around the world need to take account of in relation to this fast-growing sector including vehicle fuel sources, road safety, trip generation rates and their impacts on local residents, together with recommended actions.", "Partners": "Julian Allen \nMaja Piecyk\nMarzena Piotrowska", "Partnership Location - In London": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster (51.522023,-0.154599)", "Partnership": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "IGO\nHealthcare agency", "Policy source subcategory": "OECD\nWorld Health Organization", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "The Centre for Sustainable Road Freight\u00a0", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Understanding the transport and CO2 impacts of on-demand meal deliveries: A London case study"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.056905, 51.537543], [-0.08256, 51.491931]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "4f2fad6c03833b5568b013b5b31284b1", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments", "Project Location - In London": "Hackney Mare Street (51.5375434,-0.0569052)\nOld Kent Road (51.4919315,-0.0825598)", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10131726/7/Ferm_UP%206%283%29%20-%20Planning%20Urban%20Manufacturing%2C%20Industrial%20Building%20Typologies%2C%20and%20Built%20Environments_%20Lessons%20From%20Inner%20London.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.17645/up.v6i3.4357", "Authors": "Jessica Ferm  (The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London, UK (51.5268702,-0.1298614))\n\nDimitrios Panayotopoulos-Tsiros  (The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London, UK (51.5268702,-0.1298614))\n\nSam Griffiths (The Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL (51.53820340184632,-0.01000212278972401))", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "Despite concerns about the loss of industry, industrial land, and buildings in high-value post-industrial cities, there is concurrently a renewed enthusiasm around the potential of \u201cnew\u201d urban manufacturing and its contribution to the socio-economic diversity of cities. Yet, little is known about how planning policy can best support the retention and growth of urban manufacturing. To advance this agenda, this article proposes that we need a better understanding of industrial building typologies and resultant urban form. Using concepts developed by Julienne Hanson to analyse residential morphologies undergoing transformation under modernism, we apply these concepts to investigate the industrial, mixed-use contexts in two areas of London with concentrations of urban manufacturing\u2014Hackney Mare Street and Old Kent Road. The research presented examines how both areas have evolved historically to produce distinctive urban tissues and a range of industrial building typologies. The article reveals that, despite territorial similarities in the late 19th century, the mixed land uses and smaller plot sizes of Hackney Mare Street have allowed for a more resilient development pattern, whereas the greater separation of land uses, large plot sizes, and inward-facing development in the Old Kent Road has facilitated its reimagination for large-scale regeneration. We conclude that greater attention needs to be paid to the relationship between urban manufacturing and built urban form if policies that aim to protect or support the revival of manufacturing in cities are to avoid negative unintended consequences.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Planning Urban Manufacturing, Industrial Building Typologies, and Built Environments: Lessons From Inner London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.300407, 51.51498]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "8ec7d1f5e95865b08b9f48944d6e9952", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Postcolonial narratives and the governance of informal housing", "Project Location - In London": "The London Borough of Ealing (51.5149803,-0.3004067)", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10111327/1/RPS%20Version%20-%20Postcolonial%20Narratives%20and%20The%20Governance%20of%20Informal%20Housing%20in%20London.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.1080/19491247.2020.1840907", "Authors": "Mariana Schiller\nMike Raco", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Housing informality has traditionally been associated with cities in the Global South.

This paper, drawing on detailed policy analysis and qualitative in-depth interviews, uses the example of London to examine the rise of informal housing, the ways in which it is both represented and conceptualised as a \u2018problem\u2019 of governance to be tackled, and its institutionalisation into programmes of enforcement. It focuses on the emergence of a phenomenon known as \u2018beds in sheds\u2019, or the construction of informal housing in between existing buildings. By discussing a planning issue that is generally associated with the Global South in a Global North context, the paper engages with writings on postcolonial theory. It adopts a nexus approach to examine how the issue is embedded within particular configurations of social, political, economic and cultural circumstances. The evidence indicates that the ways in which the problem is framed and understood are underpinned by colonialist views that see migrants and their socio-ethnic communities as agents of informality, whose removal or sanction will \u2018solve\u2019 the problem.

Therefore, the aim of this research is to evaluate the journey experience of VIP using public transport. Semi-structured interviews conducted in London are used. The results show that limited access to information, inconsistencies in infrastructure and poor availability of staff assistance are the major concerns. Concessionary travel, on the other hand, encourages VIP to make more trips and hence has a positive effect on well-being. The findings suggest that more specific policies should be introduced to cater to the special needs of particular disabilities rather than generalising the types of aids available.

In the building sector, a warming climate will significantly affect building heating and cooling loads, as well as building occupant health, comfort and wellbeing. School buildings in the UK, in particular, might face additional challenges, such as indoor overheating risks due to high internal gains in classrooms, and their current reliance on natural ventilation, which might offer limited cooling capacity in the future. This paper presents a secondary school building stock indoor environment modelling framework for London. The aim of the present study is to explore the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on schoolchildren\u2019s cognitive performance levels. Using the PDSP (Property Data Survey Programme) dataset and a basic set of school building archetypes for London, a parametric stock modelling framework was developed. Weather files based on existing Test Reference Years (TRY) incorporating the UK Climate Projections 2009 scenarios were used. This study provides a detailed assessment of school building stock indoor thermal performance and students\u2019 cognitive performance. It was found that building thermal properties and ventilation rates can function as reliable predictors of students\u2019 cognitive performance, and their impacts were quantified in this study.

It undertakes feasibility work to identify possible causes of overheating across a range of care home types and evaluate the current and future potential of indicative passive solutions. The summertime thermal environments of five case study care homes were monitored and their physical, technical and occupancy profiles were established through surveys. The data was inputed in the EnergyPlus V8.9 dynamic thermal simulations via the DesignBuilder Graphical User Interface. Future overheating risks and their reduction potential through the use of passive strategies were tested under a set of representative climate change scenarios, during a five-day heatwave period. The dynamic thermal simulation analysis indicated that older buildings with higher heat loss and thermal mass capacities are likely to benefit more from the application of high albedo materials rather than external shading methods, whereas newer and highly insulated buildings seem to benefit more from higher ventilation rates and appropriate external shading systems. Night ventilation emerged as the single most impactful passive technique for all building types. This feasibility work has developed novel methods, knowledge and insights that will be helpful in understanding how to enable care settings in the UK to become resilient to rising heat stress.

Furthermore, the diversity observed in the occupants\u2019 window operation behaviour and its driving factors discourages the reliance of future modelling efforts on aggregated datasets that can suppress the inter-occupant diversity.

We outline a study conducted with young people in Hackney who are mostly in mid-adolescence (between 14-17 years old). Hackney is a borough in east London which has undergone significant social and economic transformation. We draw out the main factors which young people said influenced their ability to live a good life in Hackney and discuss their views of the London Prosperity Index. We argue that there are structural differences and value differences which affect how young people understand prosperity, and which impact their capacity to lead a good life in places which are changing significantly.

This history leads to an account of the development, since 2009, of the 3DStock method for modelling complete building stocks, both domestic and non-domestic. The paper explains how 3DStock models are built and the data sources used. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship of premises (the floorspace occupied by organisations) to buildings. Energy use may be metered at the level of premises, buildings or groups of buildings. Representing the patterns in which premises relate to buildings is therefore crucial to the modelling process, and in particular to the precise measurement of energy intensities. Applications of 3DStock models in building science and policy tools are reviewed, including the London Building Stock Model (LBSM), delivered to the Greater London Authority (GLA) in 2020. This \u2018digital twin\u2019 can be used for the monitoring, simulation and analysis of the building stock. Implications for research and policy are discussed, particularly for energy epidemiology, density, high-rise buildings, retrofit potential, energy-use intensity and benchmarking. Data are in place to extend 3DStock modelling to the whole of England and Wales. / Policy and practice relevance: The models can be used to assess energy demand in large numbers of buildings in relation to a range of variables, including built form, age, construction and activities. Poorly performing buildings can be identified, and the potential for retrofit\u2014including renewable technology installations\u2014evaluated using the same variables plus information contained in Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). Policies for addressing fuel poverty can be evaluated by making links to confidential socioeconomic data on occupants. In conjunction with a dynamic building energy-simulation tool, scenarios can be investigated for retrofit, the potential for renewables and issues in demand-side management. Additional uses are in the precise measurements of density and of the three-dimensional character of the urban fabric. There could be applications in public health, the modelling of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and the tracking of material flows. 3DStock models might also be integrated with digital twins of infrastructure systems and networks.", "Partners": "Agnieszka Griffin at the Greater London Authority (GLA)", "Partnership Location - In London": "51.507495,0.016223", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Think tank\nGovernemnt", "Policy source subcategory": "CREDS\nRoyal Society\nUK Parliament Select Committee Publications", "Partnership 1": "Data Support ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Technology and Computation ", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Building stock energy modelling in the UK: the 3DStock method and the London Building Stock Model"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "3c09dc5e58c01234301bde35df60b9b9", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Local authority travel time to London effects on house prices variation", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10107563/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "ISSN 1467-1298", "Authors": "Bin Chi\nAdam Dennett\nRobin Morphet\nChris Hutchinson", "London Authors": "Bin Chi \nDepartment of Geography, University College London (51.523919,-0.12895)\n \nChris Hutchinson \nCentre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery (51.54641797744119,-0.040935843785126116)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "The spatial and temporal diffusion of house prices has been investigated at regional level in England, with London and the South East playing a leading role in terms of spillovers to other regions.

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. METHODS: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007\u20132016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). RESULTS: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036\u20131.043 per 1 \u00b0C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026\u20131.039 and 1.043, 1.037\u20131.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality.

Completed questionnaires were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The findings revealed that the majority of Londoners would be in favour of the ban if they were sufficiently exposed to the appropriate sources of information and were favourably disposed towards environmental protection measures. The results also showed that Londoners were more likely to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) if they were offered generous incentives and encouraged to use scrappage schemes.

Ideas of urban conservation have evolved from monument restorations to Historic Urban Landscape (HUL).

Spatial networks in space syntax theory translate non-discursive dynamic urban contexts to numerical and comparable systems. This paper argues that spatial networks can provide an effective platform for studying urban heritage in a closer link with all other aspects of the city. It takes the historic core in London as a case study. By using the techniques of spatial network modelling, the research investigates how the spatial characteristics match the heritage characteristics in the historic core. Heritage networks in this research are a device that aggregates the heritage data on the spatial model and presents it in a numerical, connected system. Furthermore, high heritage-weighted clusters are defined through a statistical analysis of the heritage networks. The research shows that these clusters have different spatial and potential movement patterns. With the spatial network approach, heritage conservation can be integrated with other planning and urban design tasks and can provide a more robust evidence for an enhanced urban conservation initiative.

The method was successful in identifying isolated local area but were unsuccessful in identifying local area that was less driven by the grid but more from other urban factors. This research attempts to address this problem by embedding street characteristics in community detection to define Street Character Weighted Local Area (St-W-LA). The idea is that street neighbourhoods are not only defined by the topology of the street network but also by the morphology of the built form. In particular, we adopted Spacemate Building Density Metric in defining Density-based local area for Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Space Syntax angular choice metric in defining angular-choice-based (note. for simplicity reasons we term this betweeness-based) local area for London in the UK. We compared the results of the community detection with user defined local area through visual analysis. In general, we found the weighted and the unweighted street-based local areas to be similar. This suggests that neighbourhood characteristics (morphology) follow neighbourhood topology where areas that were built in similar times with similar density and building type were also better connected internally. However, we also found notable differences between the two methods where the weighted local area seems better in capturing the user defined local area in more continuous grids.

The essential concept of movement data conversion is to arrange the geo-tagged photos of each Flickr user per day by the time sequence during their itinerary. The sets of sorted photos will reflect the visit order each user has gone through. The geographical data of the arranged photos can be converted into the topological travel routes. Finally, the routes will be mapped onto the base map using the proposed method. The collected data from the Flickr platform provide a wide range of information from static content to movement flow.

While rooms directly underneath roofs are known to have increased overheating risks, there is little research available that quantifies this risk, and how to mitigate it cost-effectively. This paper seeks to evaluate overheating risks in loft conversions, using integrated environmental solutions virtual environment to dynamically simulate indoor temperatures in a semi-detached dwelling in London, UK, under current and future (2050s and 2080s medium and high emissions) climate scenarios. Adaptive overheating risk and energy consumption are calculated with and without passive overheating adaptations that reduce solar gains, increase ventilation, or add thermal insulation. Marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) are then used to select the most cost-effective adaptations based on installation and ongoing energy consumption costs. Results estimate 11,340\u201312,210 more summertime Category I overheating degree-hours for the loft than conventional bedrooms in the dwelling under the current climate; total category I loft overheating degree-hours may increase to 20,319 by 2080. While external shutters and night-purge ventilation were the most effective at reducing overheating degree-hours (96% and 89%, respectively), the most cost-effective solutions considering capital and ongoing costs are ventilation strategies, including night-time purge ventilation, advance ventilation and cross ventilation. Passive adaptations are not capable of eliminating overheating entirely, and by the 2080s active cooling is likely to be required to maintain comfortable indoor conditions in lofts. Practical application: Converted lofts \u2013 present in 5.8% of English and 10.8% of London dwellings \u2013 are at significantly elevated risk of high indoor temperatures relative to conventional rooms. Passive adaptations such as ventilation and shading can effectively mitigate loft overheating until around 2080, after which active measures become necessary. When capital and ongoing costs are considered, the most cost-effective heat mitigating adaptations are night and advance ventilation and internal curtains/blinds. Heat mitigating adaptations for converted lofts should become mandatory, and such spaces should not be occupied by the vulnerable or elderly during hot weather.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Indoor overheating and mitigation of converted lofts in London, UK"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "d13b345b12a82441f2142313699a5c39", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Urban Public Transport Infrastructure and Social Equity and Spatial Accessibility ", "Project Location - In London": "London Borough of Croydon (51.37687596089541, -0.09459955984608232)", "Date": "2019", "Link": "https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/item/qvw3q/the-association-between-urban-public-transport-infrastructure-and-social-equity-and-spatial-accessibility-within-the-urban-environment-an-investigation-of-tramlink-in-london", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi.org/10.3390/su11051229", "Authors": "Neil Cuthill\nMengqiu Cao\nYuqi Liu\nXing Gao\nYuerong Zhang", "London Authors": "Mengqui Cao\nDepartment of Planning and Transport,\nUniversity of Westminster, 35 Marylebone Road, London, NW1 5LS, UK (51.522499463459454, -0.15516838839364727)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Yuqi Liu\nDepartment of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam Rd, Lung Fu Shan, Hong Kong, China (22.28343405945611, 114.13847825515248)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "The pursuit of sustainability has been at the forefront of contemporary planning initiatives.

Social equity in itself is a difficult term to define, while it is still more challenging to quantify the contribution that transport investment might make to improving social equity. Four key findings are derived from the research analysis. First, it is revealed that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, not just the areas of social deprivation previously found mainly in East London. Second, it is found that there are statistically significant differences in terms of capabilities and functionings across the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, such as gender, age, ethnic origin, marital status, incumbent population, employment, personal income, housing tenure, and car ownership; and also across different neighbourhoods in London. Third, the results show that functionings and capabilities differ according to an individual\u2019s socio-economic characteristics and geographical location, meaning that both the opportunities to participate in life and also the actual activities themselves differ in the case of Beijing.

The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers issued Technical Memorandum 59 (TM59) with the aim of achieving consistency in the modelling processes followed for the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. However, as each tool\u2019s prediction may depend on its inherent assumptions, an inter-model comparison procedure was used to assess whether the choice of building performance simulation tool influences the overheating assessment. The predictions of two popular tools, IES VE and EnergyPlus, were compared for nine variations of a naturally ventilated, purpose built, London flat archetype, modelled under the default algorithm options. EnergyPlus predicted a high overheating risk according to TM59 criteria in seven out of the nine model variants, contrary to the low risk of all the IES VE variants. Analysis of heat transfer processes revealed that wind-driven ventilation and surface convection algorithms were the main sources of the observed discrepancies. The choice of simulation tool could thus influence the overheating risk assessment in flats, while the observed discrepancies in the simulation of air and heat transfer could have implications on other modelling applications. Practical application: Technical Memorandum 59 issued by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers may be widely adopted within the industry to assist the prediction of overheating risk in new dwellings. This work suggests that the choice of building performance simulation tool can greatly influence the predicted overheating risk. Furthermore, the differences identified in the modelling of heat transfer processes could also impact other modelling applications.

The aim was to investigate the potential of passive and active air sampling strategies (sampling from still and actively mixed air, respectively) to explain visible mould, and understand how home/room characteristics correlate with the obtained readings. Airborne mould levels were quantified using an Andersen sampler (passively and actively), as well as by a chemical method based on the quantification of the N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity (actively), which was also used to quantify surface mould. The mould levels were then correlated against physical characteristics of the tested homes/rooms, collected by means of survey sheets developed as part of this study. The findings did not reveal any independent variable governing all or most of the response variables, but a complex analysis suggested that whether it is a house or a flat could depict mould levels in the air and on the surfaces. It was also shown that a robust testing protocol should combine air and surface based methods, and an active air sampling strategy leads to a more accurate appraisal of airborne mould levels.

Two-year geo-tweets collected in Greater London were analyzed as a demonstrator of the framework and as a case study. The results indicate, at a disaggregated level, that the distribution of topics possess a fair degree of spatial randomness related to tweeting behavior. When aggregating tweets by zones, the areas with the same topics form spatial clusters but of entangled urban functions. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering generates a clear spatial structure with orders of centers.

These advances include the wider availability of detailed transit schedule data; the wider availability of high quality road network and average road speeds data; and the development of sophisticated open source journey planning software.

The computational feasibility of modelling multimodal travel times for a large metropolitan region is demonstrated, with the accuracy of the results validated against surveyed journey-to-work times.

Its founder Charles Robert Ashbee had a strong socialist commitment to the advancement of equality through understandings of a common built environment. The Survey\u2019s first monograph, subtitled an \u2018Object Lesson in National History\u2019, was devoted to Trinity Hospital, almshouses on the Mile End Road. It interwove architectural and social history in a preservation campaign that emphasised the social value of historic buildings. In 1910 the Survey was taken under the wing of the London County Council (LCC) where its purposes knitted well with the dominant Progressive party\u2019s determination to raise historical consciousness as a counter to the interests of private property. After the Second World War the LCC took the Survey back to its roots to re-engage with development and destruction. An early fruit of this was a volume devoted to Spitalfields (volume 27, 1957). Not only did this bring attention to the district\u2019s previously uncelebrated eighteenthcentury houses, but it also broadened to account for humble and recent buildings, even those of the inter-war period. In 2016 the Survey once again returned to East London, to work towards publication on Whitechapel, a place currently witnessing huge change. An innovation for the Survey is an interactive map-based website (\u2018Survey of London \u2013 histories of Whitechapel\u2019 http://surveyoflondon.org). This allows the public to contribute knowledge, memories and images to research on the area, a melding of \u2018official\u2019 and \u2018unofficial\u2019 history that takes the Survey onto new methodological ground.

In the vast literature on this topic, relatively little attention has paid to the demand side, and in particular, the role of unregulated investment demand. We argue that this demand is fuelled by the mortgage market, and encouraged implicitly by government policies, as a growth model for the UK economy through housing equity withdrawal, and as a privatised pension provision strategy. The financial industry, left at its own devices to create and allocate money in the form of debt in line with its short-term remit of maximising stakeholder value, issues loans and allocates it towards the highest expected return-to-risk ratio. The intrinsically low risk of housing mortgages gives housing a permanent advantage in absorbing credit, if remained unregulated. This allocation, besides being undemocratic, is not in the long-term interest of economic stability and equality. In this paper, we present an initial model built on existing literature and statistical data that serves as a first step towards an integrated model of London\u2019s house price dynamics since 1980, with a particular focus on the role of the financial markets. The model, even though at an early stage, shows promise in endogenously replicating past trends in some variables key to the current housing crisis.

Household budgets are likely to be stretched where there are high levels of car dependency and housing unaffordability \u2013 with little flexibility for rising costs in either or both of these. A composite car dependence and housing affordability (CDHA) index is developed, using indices of oil vulnerability related to car travel and housing affordability. Greater London is used as the case study, with 2001 and 2011 data analysed at the level of Lower Super Output Areas, and presented using Geographic Information System and R statistical software. The findings reveal that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, adding to the previous areas of social deprivation found mainly in East London. The composite CDHA index illustrates where the most vulnerable areas are spatially. Many neighbourhoods may become less attractive for those on median or even relatively high incomes. The areas most affected may become much more expensive to live in, potentially leading to much greater pressure on travel and housing costs as people could be forced to live further from the centre of London, including beyond the Greater London boundary, which has further implications for travel.

In response to an intensifying housing crisis and austerity-imposed fiscal constraints, municipalities in London are devising entrepreneurial solutions to deliver more housing. Among these \u2018solutions\u2019 can be found the early signs of the state-executed financialization of public housing in the UK with the use of speculative council-owned special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that replace existing public housing stock with mixed-tenure developments, creating ambiguous public/private tenancies that function as homes and the basis for liquid financial assets. Drawing together parallel literatures on the financialization of urban governance and housing, and combining these with original empirical research, we situate these developments in contrast to earlier modes of governance, identifying a distinct mode of entrepreneurial governance in London: financialized municipal entrepreneurialism. The local state is no longer merely the enabler\u2014limited to providing strategic oversight of the private sector\u2014but financializes its practice in a reimagined commercialized interventionism, as property speculator.

More than engendering a simple consolidation or intensification of \u2018business as usual\u2019 in a leaner register however, it is suggested that the current moment of austerity urbanism augurs a new operational matrix for local government with path changing consequences. Combining insights from post-foundational theory with in-depth qualitative empirical research, this thesis presents an in-depth ground-up analysis of how austerity urbanism has been \u2018policed\u2019 and \u2018politicised\u2019. It argues that a post-politicising \u2018common sense\u2019 over how austerity should be rolled-out is legible across London\u2019s local authorities, based on logics of responsibilisation, contractualisation and entrepreneurialism. On the one hand, local authorities are managing demand for and divesting of services by responsibilising staff, community groups, and residents under the auspices of participatory governance whilst extending and deepening contractual arrangements with non-governmental and private providers. On the other hand, under pressure to generate new forms of revenue, local authorities are forming new real-estate special purpose vehicles to create and capture urban land and property value as rents. Whilst seeming to reproduce a condition of \u2018post-political\u2019 closure, as austerity deepens and contradictions sharpen these modes of local governance face mounting dissent from a growing part with no part. In this context, the political horizon of local government is an ambivalent one. At a moment of closure, austerity urbanism is producing opportunities for radical democratic openings even if they do not yet suggest a tipping point that could change how and for whom local government works.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD Thesis", "Title": "The (post)-politics of austerity urbanism: Policing and politicising local governance in London after the crisis"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "944b030000061bb5bcc01a26ab877272", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London\u2019s Railway Terminus Neighbourhoods", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2018", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1566758/1/Wrong_Side_of_the_Tracks_Tom_Bolton.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1566758/1/Wrong_Side_of_the_Tracks_Tom_Bolton.pdf", "Authors": "Thomas Bolton", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "The commonly-used phrase \u2018the wrong side of the tracks\u2019 implies that railway lines separate places as a matter of course, with economic and social consequences. London has more railway termini than any other world city, with apparent economic, social and spatial differences between places located in front of them and those behind. Contemporary research focuses on transport functions, on the economic potential of station buildings and on the potential for rail to increase catalyse redevelopment, while ignoring their role as the largest buildings in the city, creating separation within the street network. This thesis analyses eight main London railway termini in two time periods: the 1880s and the 2010s. These stations are served by different infrastructure types, from cuttings to viaducts, which form movement barriers in areas located behind them, which are also associated with social decline and post-industrial redevelopment. Space syntax analysis uncovers the impacts of railway termini and their associated structures on movement networks. The economic and social character of areas around the stations is then analysed, to identify differences between neighbourhoods in front of and behind stations. Historical data is mapped and compared with contemporary data, including land uses for both periods and social data from the Booth Poverty Survey, which is compared to contemporary income estimates. Analysis of spatial, social and economic character shows how the railway has influenced neighbourhoods located behind termini over a long period of time. The nature of this influence depends on infrastructure type, viaducts being associated with less separation than other railway structures. This research is significant for the long-term redevelopment of railway termini, demonstrating their importance as an integral part of the city and the significance of understanding the separation they create.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD Thesis", "Title": "Wrong Side of the Tracks?

The long-term sustainability of the town centre has been shown to correspond to its configurational spatial signatures. Where high streets exhibit a high ethnic diversity amongst proprietors, there appears to be a corresponding diversity of land use and goods, with a tendency to adapt and alter space for greater economic benefit. Small independent units are often further subdivided to accommodate a greater number of services and products. In the context of the local high street in the UK, the small independent Minority Ethnic Business (MEB) is a common feature, whether it is a halal butcher, an Indian chemist or a Chinese takeaway, serving both an embedded local minority community as well as often having a wider mainstream appeal. This paper seeks to examine the relationship between spatial configuration and socio-economic diversity of the local high street to investigate whether the potential for diversity is embedded in its contextual spatial characteristics. For the purpose of this study using nationally defined town centre boundaries, ten town centre case studies were selected from around London based on their residential ethnic profile and the level of deprivation of the area. Building on the literature that shows that land use diversity is associated with the persistence of smaller town centres, we test the proposition that it is also associated with the presence of MEBs. Here we tested the degree of impact of MEB presence on commercial diversity across these case studies. Additionally, the study examines the spatial and morphological signatures of these case studies and how these relate to the context of MEB presence and land use diversity, finding a strong relationship between spatial and urban form factors and a greater presence of MEBs. The study concludes that given the importance of spatial accessibility coupled with built form diversity to the presence of MEBs, greater attention needs to be given to the embedded social value in the spatial characteristics of town centres.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "The spatial configuration of minority ethnic business diversity in London\u2019s high streets"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "85d8f920ba6a23fef843650158efcb54", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London in Skateboarding Films", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1547546/1/Borden-SkateboardCity-2017.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1547546/1/Borden-SkateboardCity-2017.pdf", "Authors": "Iain Borden", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "London has been part of the worldwide phenomenon of skateboarding, from the early 1970s right through to the present day.

This chapter charts the documentation of skateboarding in the UK capital as caught on film, showing how these sites made up a vibrant skateboarding scene. In doing so, it also charts the dramatically changing technologies by which these film documentations occurred, from the earliest days of amateur movies and sporadic news coverage (capturing the relatively innocent arrival of skateboarding as a youthful pastime), through camcorder footage of the burgeoning street-skateboarding scene of the 1990s (raising issues of subculture, urban space and masculinity) through to today\u2019s scene, where a plethora of art-based films, documentaries, social media clips and guerrilla-style advertising have become an integral part of a rich and pluralistic skateboard scene.

However, the spatial configurations which could stimulate the transformation around the neighbourhoods of the station have not been clearly identified. It could be argued that the implementation of transport systems and the creation of new stations would enhance the mobility of the transport network and the accessibility around the station\u2019s vicinity. Furthermore, the dynamics of pedestrian flow, generated by the new transport system might transform the social, cultural and economic activities around the stations. Therefore, the aims of this study are to analyse how the spatial configuration and the urban formation are affected by the implementation of stations and understand how the new stations emerge in the urban form. The Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) in East London, which started to operate in 2000, plays an essential role in connecting Central London with the recently developed financial district in the east. This study focuses on two stations located along the JLE, Bermondsey and West Ham, which have different topological and demographic characteristics. To determine whether the stations integrate cohesively with the urban environment, this study applies Space Syntax methods of spatial network analysis to evaluate the spatial characteristics and compares with GIS data of the house prices and land use distribution before and after the JLE. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between pedestrian movement and the distribution of residential and commercial activities within the street network structure.

The surviving building bears little resemblance to the plain, practical hospital built in open fields south of Whitechapel Road between 1752 and 1778. Its Georgian core has been concealed by numerous extensions; by the 1940s the hospital was effectively a sprawling \u2018small town\u2019. Little is known about its architect, Boulton Mainwaring, whose modest career caused George III to remark that he was merely \u2018some tradesman\u2019, and has fostered doubt that he could have been sole designer of the hospital. Research carried out for the Survey of London has clarified that Mainwaring played a pivotal role in securing a site and designing a new building, yet has also revealed that the London Hospital\u2019s architectural history was shaped by a network of collaboration. The collaborative energy behind the scenes of great building projects is rarely glimpsed in surviving records, and much less written about as a topic of interest. This account of the early history of the London Hospital analyses its first ambitious building project and recognises the multiple voices which guided it to completion, from the charity\u2019s surveyor, medical minds and governors to a charismatic bishop memorialised as an \u2018Institutor of Infirmaries\u2019.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "What the doctors ordered: the early history of the London Hospital, 1740\u201378"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "55e523e90c92642ec0aad1f40fab3b3d", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The impact of e-commerce on last-mile light goods vehicle activity", "Project Location - In London": "Central London", "Date": "2018", "Link": "https://doi-org.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.020", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://doi-org.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.020", "Authors": "S.

This paper provides an insight into the reasons behind this growth and the resulting effort required to meet the exacting delivery services offered by e-retailers which often lead to poor vehicle utilisation in the last-mile operation, as well as the duplication of delivery services in urban centres as competitors vie for business. A case study investigating current parcel delivery operations in central London identified the scale of the challenge facing the last-mile parcel delivery driver, highlighting the importance of walking which can account for 62% of the total vehicle round time and 40% of the total round distance in the operations studied. The characteristics of these operations are in direct conflict with the urban infrastructure which is being increasingly redesigned in favour of walking, cycling and public transport, reducing the kerbside accessibility for last-mile operations. The paper highlights other pressures on last-mile operators associated with managing seasonal peaks in demand; reduced lead times between customers placing orders and deliveries being made; meeting delivery time windows; first-time delivery failure rates and the need to manage high levels of product returns. It concludes by describing a range of initiatives that retailers and parcel carriers, sometimes in conjunction with city authorities, can implement to reduce the costs associated with last-mile delivery, without negatively impacting on customer service levels.", "Partners": "J.

The literature has framed this feature of the London property market as the revival of the estate model of development. That is, on the one hand, it is argued that the well-known London\u2019s Old estates are evolving from handsoff family businesses into professionally actively managed portfolios. On the other hand, it is argued that there are emerging clusters of ownership similarly actively managed. However, little is known yet about why property owners choose to cluster their portfolios, challenging risk diversification theories, what their active management comprises and in what institutional context they operate. Using an institutional account, this research examines clusters of ownership exploring their investment and management strategies and how the institutional environment affects these strategies. Methodologically, this research follows a multiple case study design and combines quantitative and qualitative methods, with predominantly qualitative methods. Quantitative data sources include the annual reports of property companies, which were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative methods include semi-structured interviews with cluster owners and other stakeholders, which were analysed using content analysis. Research findings suggest that property owners derive a threefold advantage from clustering and actively managing their property portfolio. First, they gain an edge over the market including new acquisitions by their detailed local knowledge and concentrated ownerships. Second, they deploy an instrumentalised form of place-making in their neighbourhood by curating the mix of uses and tenant mix, their placement, and the space in-between the buildings. Third, they can occupy some of the empty governance space left by a budget-strapped planning system. These private interest-led forceful practices, coupled with a receding planning system, present new challenges to urban governance power dynamics.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Planning, place-making and property markets in inner-London: the active management of clusters of ownership"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "5938d58a89d3d39b936807acb23e50e8", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London\u2019s traditional markets: managing change and conflict", "Project Location - In London": "Petticoat Lane street market (51.51645906277231, -0.07681262432399387) \nBorough Market (51.505716132403606, -0.09019112331166497)", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1546153/1/Kim_Sang%20Hee_PhD%20thesis.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1546153/1/Kim_Sang%20Hee_PhD%20thesis.pdf", "Authors": "Sang Hee Kim", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "With the continual change in the everyday life and operation of London's traditional markets, this thesis explores the dynamic relationship between market use, management, and physicality, in order to understand these complex urban public spaces, and how practices of market management can help to enhance and safeguard the diversity of London's markets as public places of social experience and meaning. The theoretical research consisted of a review of the academic literature on public space and traditional markets using a multi-dimensional, and inter-disciplinary approach, and the empirical research involved both a typological analysis of the traditional markets in inner London\u2019s 13 boroughs, and then an in-depth case study investigation of two of these inner London markets. This was undertaken to answer the research question of how to ensure the economic viability and social vitality of inner London's traditional markets, and respond to the challenges, tensions and opportunities presented in these complex inner city environments. London's markets need to adapt to survive because urban public spaces are continually evolving. The typological analysis of inner London's traditional markets and the case studies of the declining Petticoat Lane street market and the thriving Borough Market highlight the role of management in maintaining the markets as viable economic and social public spaces for all. Along with a strategic plan based on a vision emphasising the social and economic value of markets to their local communities, a partnership approach is key for effective and responsive micro-management. A balance between economic viability and social vitality for public spaces serving the socio-economically diverse local communities in inner London can be achieved through managing on-going tensions over time.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD Thesis", "Title": "London\u2019s traditional markets: managing change and conflict in complex urban spaces"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "79d49689853409dc22d4bc6742114ed5", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "LCA of energy conservation during early stage office building design", "Project Location - In London": "Central London", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1552588/1/Mavrogianni_MANUSCRIPT_FINAL.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1552588/1/Mavrogianni_MANUSCRIPT_FINAL.pdf", "Authors": "Afaf Azzouz\nAnna Mavrogianni\nMeike Borchers\nJuliana Moreira", "London Authors": "Meike Borchers\nJuliana Moreira\nWSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff, 70 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1AF, UK (51.51812779115053, -0.11325016564039062)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "Embodied versus operational environmental indicators are often studied in isolation.

Operational energy saving techniques included the adoption of a fabric-first approach, adaptive thermal conditions and sustainable building systems. Cumulatively, these optimization strategies achieved a maximum of 16% and 13% savings on life cycle carbon and energy, respectively, compared to the original design. Embodied strategies saved 32% and 9% on embodied carbon and energy, respectively, while operational strategies reduced the original consumption by 14% on both indicators.

Understanding why businesses in some industries cluster is a key issue in urban economic theory, particularly in the Marshallian and Jacobsian traditions. These emphasize the logistical and informational synergies (advantages) that accrue to firms in agglomeration economies, allowing firms located near one another to accelerate their rate of innovation. However, little is known about how spatial forms foster the clustering of firms or the mechanisms through which this process might facilitate knowledge spillover over between different businesses. In this paper we present an historical case study in which space syntax methods, archival research and urban economic theory were used to enhance understanding of the spatial ordering of London's nineteenth-and early twentieth-century furniture industry, a sector characterised by a proliferation of small, local firms. The spatial morphologies of the furniture industry in the Shoreditch and Fitzrovia areas of London are profiled by linking business directories, historical Ordnance Survey maps and Goad fire insurance plans to space syntax measures describing the spatial configuration of London's street network, on a GIS platform. Historically, the two casestudy areas have hosted a wide range of furniture-manufacturing businesses. We hypothesise that the contrast between the spatial structures of the two districts contributed to the divergent paths development of the furniture industry in these places. Our results suggest the two areas developed as different knowledge economies, in part as a consequence of their contrasting spatial configurations and their influence on industrial organization. Shoreditch became a 'specialization' economy (i.e. Marshallian). Here the organic pattern of streets allowed specialized businesses to be located in close proximity to key streets, benefiting from more local footfall, and in close localization of firms belonging to the same industry. Fitzrovia, however, showed a more 'diversified' economy (i.e. Jacobsian), accommodating most of its retailers on streets highly integrated across scales and more commercially-driven. In the context of constraints of land use and rising land values, manufacturing operations moved to other places whilst retaining large-size firms that created a retail destination in a high footfall location good for attracting passing trade. We anticipate that this research will contribute to understanding the distinctive spatial cultures of urban manufacturing and to the development of a methodological approach that opens up new prospects for inter-disciplinary research.", "Partners": "Laura Narvaez Zertuche", "Partnership Location - In London": "Urban Design Group, Foster + Partners Ltd.

It is also experienced daily by workers and other citizens driving vehicles, serving in shops, caring for each other, cleaning, starting businesses and struggling to succeed or even survive. The city\u2019s economy generates immense wealth but also alarming levels of in-work poverty. Official accounts of the economy tend to emphasise high-productivity sectors, increasingly concentrated in office blocks in the centre, while half the activity is distributed through the city and made up of small enterprises and interlocking sub-contractors. The pressure on these activities is increasingly intense because of the inflated prices which land commands if shifted into use for housing development. Thus there has been a great deal of displacement in recent decades and there is growing controversy about how much workspace London can afford to lose. Furthermore the economy faces two major uncertainties in the next few years: the revision of business rates which threatens many enterprises and the consequences of Brexit, via changes in the terms of trade, inflation and curbs on labour mobility. Researchers at UCL\u2019s Bartlett School have just published the report on a small research project evaluating the various ways in which the diverse economies of London are understood, studied and planned for. Principal findings of the research are that Top-down studies of the London economy fail to connect with the growing number of Borough-level and bottom-up studies of economic activity in localities. This seriously weakens policy-making. Community groups and local business networks often have a strong understanding of the inter-connections between activities but these tend not to be assimilated into policy studies. Some standardisation of methodologies used in local studies would help to build a strategic picture and would generate the kind of local audits which need to preceed and inform policy decisions. Statisticians, planners and economists need to give more thought to some of the key concepts and categories which are used or needed in the analysis and understanding of local economies at various scales. There is great potential for productive discussion among statisticians, planners and economists at the various levels of government, resident and business communities in localities, and researchers. A shared repository of studies is needed so that best practice can more easily be shared and to avoid each study reinventing the wheel. Longitudinal studies of workers, firms and localities are never done but are essential if policy is to be adequately grounded in an understanding of how the city\u2019s economies interact and how planning can optimise conditions for all concerned.

New buildings, ancient ruins, construction sites, royal visits, wars, theatre performances, exotic expeditions, historical essays and innumerable other subjects gave occasion to feature the built, whether for its own sake or as background setting. Images and texts were produced and consumed with an urge and at a speed never seen before. The building, through the illustrated press, left the static confines of the book and the framed print and became peopled by the purposeful bourgeoisie. Through a close analysis of a range of articles on the new Royal Exchange, the refurbished London Colosseum as well as the Queen\u2019s Scotland tour, this essay explores the role of the architectural image in the illustrated press by focusing on its relationship to the accompanying text. Untangling the mechanics of representation and perception, it identifies modes of intellectual, affective, and kinetic vision through which architecture was represented to the remote reading public. By externalising and stabilising vision, the Illustrated London News thus created a virtual public sphere in which the dramatic technological and material changes occurring in the period could be absorbed and normalized.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "To the great public': The Architectural Image in the Early Illustrated London News"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.121313, 51.460466]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "9bcf64fd2e446f9446aa4cfb58fe23e1", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The politics of Cooperative Governance at a time of Austerity Localism ", "Project Location - In London": "London Borough of Lambeth (51.4604662,-0.1213128)", "Date": "2016", "Link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2016.1235932", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2016.1235932", "Authors": "Joe Penny", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "At a time of austerity localism, this paper explores how local authorities in London, England, are simultaneously addressing the dual pressures of delivering fiscal retrenchment and of enrolling citizens in new participatory public service arrangements, asking whether \u201cthese trends pull against one another, in opposite directions, or whether they are the tough and tender dimensions of a singular process: austerian management\u201d Drawing on empirical research into the London Borough of Lambeth\u2019s Cooperative Council agenda, as well as Foucauldian and Gramscian critiques of participatory network governance theories and practice, this paper shows how participatory forms of governance can be folded into the logic of hierarchy and coercion through various governmental technologies of performance and agency (consent), and through tactics of administrative domination (coercion).

A transition to more environmentally sustainable travel has proved difficult to achieve, particularly in suburban areas. For individuals in society there are many different aspirations for, and constraints on, travelling in an environmentally sustainable manner. Lack of modal choice, route options, the cost of using public transport, and wider cultural norms are a few of the barriers to realizing a more sustainable transport network. Compounding this is the 'last mile' problem, concerning the facilities linking the main mode to the home, workplace or wider destination, which are often poor. This paper explores both the perceptions and opinions of everyday commuters in Ealing, London, including consideration of their localized lastmile issues. An in-depth study is undertaken with thirty-five employees of Ealing Council, using Q methodology to investigate the participants' perceptions towards, and awareness of, their respective journeys. The Q method analysis undertaken highlighted four major discourses associated with travel and the last mile problem in Ealing: 'the public transport user', 'the committed cyclist', 'the multi-modal traveller' and 'the frustrated traveller'. Understanding these different discourses and their unique characteristics has significant potential for assisting policy-makers and planners in developing more targeted investment priorities, policies, and stakeholder engagement strategies.", "Partners": "Ealing Council", "Partnership Location - In London": "14 Uxbridge Rd, London W5 2HL (51.513207002689924, -0.3076413453114308)", "Partnership": "Research participation", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Discourses, travel behaviour and the 'last mile' in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "20e21869e3fce436128ebe3bf5b81f9c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London Hybrid Exposure Model", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2016", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1522384/7/Taylor_acs.est.6b01817.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1522384/7/Taylor_acs.est.6b01817.pdf", "Authors": "Jonathon G.

For comparison and to estimate exposure misclassification we compared Londoners LHEM exposure with exposure at the residential address, a commonly used exposure metric in epidemiological research. In 2011, the mean annual LHEM exposure to outdoor sources was estimated to be 37% lower for PM2.5 and 63% lower for NO2 than at the residential address. These decreased estimates reflect the effects of reduced exposure indoors, the amount of time spent indoors (\u223c95%), and the mode and duration of travel in London. We find that an individual\u2019s exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 outside their residential address is highly correlated (Pearson\u2019s R of 0.9). In contrast, LHEM exposure estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 suggest that the degree of correlation is influenced by their exposure in different transport modes. Further development of the LHEM has the potential to increase the understanding of exposure error and bias in time-series and cohort studies and thus better distinguish the independent effects of NO2 and PM2.5.", "Partners": "Transport for London", "Partnership Location - In London": "65 Broadway, London SW1H 0BD (51.50015678046693, -0.13387705732143002)", "Partnership": "Data support", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Government ", "Policy source subcategory": "UK Government", "Partnership 1": "Data Support ", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "Funder 2": "Medical Research Council (MRC)", "Funder 3": "Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "London Hybrid Exposure Model: Improving Human Exposure Estimates to NO2 and PM2.5 in an Urban Setting"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "ceaf68e0a5223eea7d6c1f978841d105", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Valuing and planning for industry in London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1508445/1/PDF_Proof%20for%20uploading%20to%20repository.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1508445/1/PDF_Proof%20for%20uploading%20to%20repository.pdf", "Authors": "Jessica Ferm", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "This paper examines the challenges that planners face if industry is to survive and thrive in a growing \u2018post-industrial\u2019 city. It examines London, where the difference between the value of land for residential and industrial use, and the pressure to address the housing crisis, is leading to the rapid loss of industrial land and premises. The paper first explores the role of industry in a high-value city such as London, arguing that trends in manufacturing in advanced economies are increasing the benefit for firms of an urban location, whilst at the same time, cities continue to need industry if they are to be economically and socially resilient, sustainable and vibrant. The paper then explores current approaches to planning for industry in London, identifying impacts of a policy framework that anticipates and plans for its decline. Finally, it focuses on the question of how to plan for a productive and inclusive city: we explore the arguments in favour of integrating industry into the urban fabric as well as the benefits of separating land uses and retaining employment land designations, and reveal how urbanists are divided. We argue that if London is to continue to prosper, and meet the needs of all Londoners, then we need to strategically and proactively plan for industry in the city, to experiment with innovative ways of integrating it with other city uses, whilst protecting land for industry, where required. We put forward a critical research agenda to effectively meet this challenge in the future.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Think Tank\nThink Tank, university affiliated", "Policy source subcategory": "IZA Institute of Labor Economics (Belgium)\nBennett Institute for Public Policy (UK)", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Beyond the 'post-industrial' city: valuing and planning for industry in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "183aec5b43f2d818d3511eb01b667e33", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The economic benefits of reducing nitrogen dioxide near schools", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2016", "Link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479716303863?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=8a42bdeea99abecb", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272592/1-s2.0-S0301479716X00138/1-s2.0-S0301479716303863/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAgaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQDnH%2FXSR6AcaMHWNUt9N1xc%2FSVj1KlXDoNHCewviNY2hwIhAL4S%2BfiOlu9ZV5Am4cHYPf67QjOLYJNhoL6Kbj9xp2gMKrsFCMD%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQBRoMMDU5MDAzNTQ2ODY1IgwIPINzWX%2FEFDQHr5QqjwVLcuzTftEAtdGu5QpsEWI%2FLt%2Bv7lkeeQ%2B4DlqUZd6YxUGFYtGiVERim%2FMhQw5p%2Fn8JYnQd%2BPJZUwBcJnTUlxHhue0jVzUt%2BC1ICtWKX8lnJ%2FPhAW%2BSSkN7k3pKbu75vfdndVV7KXM%2FwZfZX%2F3x3mKOValzUzr6398lCFp6S%2BpEPgT8Vv9cUThF35Tfv3p2Cq5OqgwRr44qK6XZVZT3UO0n3%2BYilpH5ABjfH42H5WcIq1NVHEdItLPDEy7ClZ0oYY3Mcv9I5ZjrjSqYsCCTxdZ%2BDjgM2t76cHtq%2FJ5SImDkGPVH8mFeXtpPQtwzR5KajLhK2BEfgFW%2B7pNC3j8NaB6A6GO%2BBYmcpialECB8tKBY%2BL%2BG5PrHW23IP0ijDZywBSKsSy4PnitTQfzlsUxn815qP3Z7BrQEvzuW4PkWbbZ2FUhMpzx9XpEiWzZfjRBOiqtQfSKxYfaRIAWrE3h7HOunMfY9wYpu8W4Bw%2FNpS18wy7v1wbRuu99Xr12JRk8Pps8qhW4ohHhhJK7xoJWUZBtQTI7%2F%2B7%2B9Sam3NmXD%2BA9vVqIMmXreGLCrQXbEjhoTTQ5lhiP5eyhn%2BzX8g3KjKb1G%2FSo8B2y5kPinC19g1s3hFuDRKo%2B7stX5YcFS0tMab%2BVgp%2BWwXVwAuu9qKGvbPRey0%2For2LbwxlAa2PLf0gJCBrsm%2F58glJR5gs9c8HR6DPqKe77ySQczG8I6oc4uW1r1BDU0kr3YvPfRsPm1lU4WeGUsXKLmQKyQhvMNXJCAk1shNgeFDagc8%2FFHMcMNCcUDf%2B9IijygaK54ALyw1DyWHTvtM2I3UK4C8Std68hr9vKNZNLvn8s%2F3mzg%2BHqIvA6clQdocqbA5ED8NLHWq2nmMICcoLQGOrABuIEH2t3%2F293zdLkbuP5OvwZFw5E25wXm%2BhhBeH400Sa1hmicSX1IPUUFO7BfJYs1hDhRSgOj%2F9J%2FM79qehKYzD9UMKEilHe%2BJgZ1%2F0TbdWhSQqv%2F7ycWKpw1e%2BjSQDIEqTsLt7vwsE41UfuVWRvQVmg8COD4tGbOFTV65uSTEtRJGnk26Fs9kb7lB%2FFZYYCP7IQlZtVQM%2FB0ozBcivYHHO9vrL4caD2nwquGBfWS%2FuM%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20240705T155025Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYY2YJU5AY%2F20240705%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=744695dc4a98393f4f6ecf5a82cb959547e95e8fe162781f55d0aace9d0d9e16&hash=72be68507e5f4a163d4e32273ab7a04f520e549b77059ccc87a755d421af7ba3&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S0301479716303863&tid=spdf-cc970c96-c7d5-433e-adae-56cb4ab5ea28&sid=54f107bc39b39942a8893489518f05752ad4gxrqb&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LXNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QtY29tLmxpYnByb3h5LnVjbC5hYy51aw%3D%3D&ua=1d045d5c065a5a52000557&rr=89e882ba0cf145a0&cc=gb", "Authors": "\nDejan Mumovic\nJohn Cairns \nCarla Guerriero \nLia Chatzidiakou ", "London Authors": "Carla Guerriero (HSRP London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 15-17 Tavistock Place, WC1H 9SH London, UK, 51.52556872037974, -0.12598366138699496)\n\nJohn Cairns (Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, WC1H 9SH Tavistock Place, London, UK, 51.52556872037974, -0.12598366138699496)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Carla Guerriero (DISES, Universita di Napoli Federico II, CSEF, Via Cintia 80126, Naples, Italy, 40.84021035697678, 14.185877112616563)\n\nLia Chatzidiakou (Centre for Atmospheric Science, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, UK, 52.197884085157504, 0.12758638410234346)", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "Providing a healthy school environment is a priority for child health.

It seeks to identify the spatial conditions that, at multiple scales, mediate and support the operation of digital industries in inner-city locations. Drawing on \u2018productionist\u2019 approaches, which examine creative industries as an industry, work is conceptualized as six activities (producing, meeting, networking, learning, displaying, socializing) performed across four spatial settings: the extended workplace, workspaces, industry events, and the neighbourhood. This qualitative case study uses three data collection methods: semi-structured interviews with workers and industry actors, observations of selected settings, and secondary data. The area is an emergent cluster of digital firms known as \u2018Silicon Roundabout\u2019 and \u2018Tech City\u2019, providing a less explored but relevant case. The thesis\u2019 contribution is threefold. First, it provides an empirical account of the spatiality of digital work in Shoreditch. This reveals a network of spaces used for work (base, ancillary, and events) suggesting a reconfiguration, and extension, of the \u2018workplace\u2019 in these industries. This spatial extension is limited and associated with spatial requirements of the tasks involved; the office still plays a central role in digital production. Second, the study identifies macro and micro spatial conditions that mediate and support these work patterns across the four spatial settings and advances the conceptualization of functional, social, and symbolic aspects of these relationships, expanding the understanding of why and how place matters in the digital economy. Third, the analysis reveals that \u2018structured interaction\u2019 and micro processes of spatial segregation and exclusion are critical to support a range of work and social practices in digital production. In contrast to influential accounts that associate creative cities with diversity and tolerance, at the scale of these spatial practices, processes of selection and quest for sameness underpin the operation of these industries within urban space(s).", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "\u00a0", "Partnership": "\u00a0", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "\u00a0", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "\u00a0", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis, full text not available", "Title": "Tangible Places for Intangible Products: The Role of Space in the Creative Digital Economy, Tech City, London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.078017, 51.511861]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "602b9ee5d7fa635ce62ee53ae0e64310", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "A material history of the City of London", "Project Location - In London": "City of London (51.5118606,-0.0780174)", "Date": "2016", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1475768", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1475768", "Authors": "Amy Thomas", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Much of the current anxiety surrounding the financial system has emerged because of its perceived obscurity, scale and intangibility. The digitalisation and deregulation of the industry since the 1950s has been at the heart of this fear, giving rise to a situation whereby the more complex and rapid financial transactions become, the less visible and less easily regulated they are. Consequently the global economy is often perceived to be a black box within which immaterial capital-flows circulate, unencumbered by the inconveniences of geography or the built environment. Yet the reality of this system is far from friction free. The world of financial services is orchestrated around people and places, co-ordinated through infrastructure and architecture, and accommodated in offices and cities. While the financial transaction itself may be an immaterial act, it relies upon a set of specific material conditions to take place. This thesis is an exploration of those conditions. Through an analysis of the urban and architectural development of the City of London, London\u2019s financial district, in the post-war period, the research considers the extent to which there is a relationship between the structure of the financial system and the structure of the environment in which it operates. This thesis is the first comprehensive material investigation of a financial centre to date. Furthermore, it is the first study that can claim to have looked at the recent architectural history of the City of London in any depth. Buttressed by two episodes of destructive violence \u2013 World War II and the IRA bombings of the early 90s \u2013 which would each herald a new urban paradigm, the research charts the gradual deregulation of the UK finance industry and its manifestation in the built form, socio-spatial arrangement, and cultural milieu of the financial centre. Structured in the shape of a conceptual cross-section, the thesis is organised into four chapters that move from the urban scale of the City, through its streets, across its facades and into the micro-geography of its interiors, in the form of trading floors, offices and furniture. The aim is not to provide a descriptive inventory of buildings and streets, but rather to connect each material layer to the wider economic and regulatory developments in the global economy, thereby creating a constant dialogue between financial place and financial space.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "\u00a0", "Partnership": "\u00a0", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "\u00a0", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "\u00a0", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis, full text not available", "Title": "A material history of the City of London, 1945-1993: architecture, planning and finance"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c4446dfe7bb2b4fd0ea2865317458b22", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Temporal Mobility Patterns with Smart-Card Data", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2015", "Link": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294256843_Variability_in_Regularity_Mining_Temporal_Mobility_Patterns_in_London_Singapore_and_Beijing_Using_Smart-Card_Data", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1371/journal.pone.0149222", "Authors": "Chen Zhong\nMichael Batty\nEd Manley\nJiaqiu Wang\nZijia Wang\nFeng Chen\nGerhard Schmitt", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Zijia Wang\nFeng Chen\nSchool of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, No.3 Shangyuancun, Haidian District, Beijing, P.

Previous research has revealed universal regularities at mainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales. We demonstrate this by comparing regularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all temporal scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various characteristics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for the management of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.", "Partners": "Transport for London\n", "Partnership Location - In London": "Transport for London, E20 1JN, (51.5420211, -0.0091897)\u00a0\n", "Partnership": "Data support\n", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "\u00a0", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Data support", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "European Research Council (ERC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "\u00a0", "Title": "Variability in Regularity: Mining Temporal Mobility Patterns in London, Singapore and Beijing Using Smart-Card Data"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "7162733c514e00c6c801d7610348f80c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Southbank Skateboarding and Urban Culture", "Project Location - In London": "Undercroft at the Southbank Centre, SE1 8XX, (51.5057680, -0.1168001),\u00a0\nHungerford Bridge, SE1 8NZ, (51.5051264, -0.1048809)\u00a0\nHouse of Vans, SE1 8SW, (51.5027074, -0.1132521)", "Date": "2015", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1469241/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "113882982X", "Authors": "Iain Borden", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Over the last two years, skateboarding space in London has been subject to considerable controversy, debate and development.

This paper presents the methods, results and policy implications of a comparative study aiming to understand mobility attitudes and behaviours in the wider metropolitan regions of Berlin and London. We specifically considered information and communication technology (ICT), new types of mobility services such as car sharing, electric cars and residential preferences. In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture.

This research conjectures that spatial network local-areas as defined by community detection methods can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets. In order to test this conjecture, the hedonic approach will be used as an empirical strategy on the case study of London.

The study also found that spatial network local area as defined by community detection technique can be used to identify spatial housing submarkets to explain house price. The contribution of this research is it represents a proof of concept in the use of community detection techniques in the definition of spatial housing submarket. Importantly it illustrates the significance in how spatial configuration influences housing market not just in terms of accessibility (Law et al. 2013) but also in terms of housing submarket.

Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is such a concept. The objective of the FS-MaaS project is to propose the design of a MaaS concept for London, the MaaS-London, and examine its feasibility. To work towards the concept of MaaS-London, first, the supply and the demand sides of the London transport market are analysed. There are a variety of mobility services supplied in London such as car clubs (car sharing), ride sharing, bike sharing, public transport, rail and taxi which altogether make London an ideal ground to exploit MaaS-London. The MaaS-London is an integrated platform that includes registration and package selection, intermodal journey planning, booking, smart ticketing and payment functions so that the entire chain of transport can be managed in this centralised platform. The most outstanding feature of MaaS-London is the provision of mobility packages, which consist of tailored bundles of mobility services customised to individual needs. The feasibility study indicates that the introduction of MaaS-London will benefit both the supply and the demand side. Transport operators will benefit by creating a larger market via the integrated platform. Travellers will also welcome the concept due to travel expense and time reduction, and better service experience.

The core inquiry applies a configurational analysis to the street, viewing it as a complex entity which interfaces with both buildings and the urban street network. The research is founded on the identification of two theoretical and methodological gaps in the canon of urban design: how generic building morphology properties relate to street liveability; and, how urban diversity emerges as the result of diachronic processes. The thesis looks at architecture beyond function, geometry and aesthetics, focusing on the urban street as a generator for social contact. Building on space syntax theory, it seeks to advance the concept of the \u2018virtual community\u2019, proposing that encounter and co-presence patterns are the product of both city-wide connections and local building morphology. In order to study building-street relations in terms of the virtual community the thesis has developed a series of specialised techniques to describe and analyse the synchronic and diachronic aspects of space. The thesis is innovative in integrating space syntax and Conzenian methods to better examine the micromorphology of the street interface configurationally and typologically, capturing the changing nature of built form and building use over time. This methodology is applied to the study of two contrasting urban areas: Islington, London and West Village, Manhattan. Both possess similar building morphologies that have sustained street liveability and diversity over centuries. The results show how urban change and diversity are affected by diachronic processes working with the synchronic structure of the everyday city. The thesis asserts that urban configuration and built form together play an essential role in shaping the character of the \u2018virtual community\u2019 as well as the potential for street life itself.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Design", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Between buildings and streets: a study of the micromorphology of the London terrace and the Manhattan row house 1880-2013"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "d21dca55faef631a17ee3755517769e1", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Lower Class Migration to Eighteenth Century London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2014", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1522141", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1522141", "Authors": "Adam Dennett\nAdam Crymble\nTim Hitchcock\nLouise Falcini", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Adam Crymble\nDepartment of Humanities, University of Hertfordshire, College Ln, Hatfield AL10 9AB, (51.7528822, -0.2421789)\n\nTim Hitchcock\nDepartment of History, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH, (50.8644639, -0.0870488)\n\nLouise Falcini\nDepartment of History, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH, (50.8644639, -0.0870488)\n3.

This paper travels back in time to look for the foundations of these cities\u2019 architectural and urban morphology. The study is focused on the architecture of the everyday, the vernacular buildings which collectively form the character of a city\u2019s historical built environment. It discusses how both preconceived frameworks and emergent architectural decisions and societal rules have shaped the two cities throughout their spatial histories. Drawing evidence from historical and empirical data the analysis presented in this paper builds on space syntax research which investigates morphological processes in urban configurations. The paper looks at two contrasting cases of urban grids to contribute to the understanding of the way different spatial arrangements influence city form. The urban past of London and Manhattan is considered in terms of planning intentions, architecture, urban form and the embodied socio-cultural models and ideals. The approach emphasises the way architectural and urban scales were configured together to produce each city\u2019s historical morphological identity and spatial culture. This stems from an effort to form a parallel understanding of both the building unit and the urban realm where this is situated. In this perspective, the discussion provides an overview on the one hand, of the building aggregation rules of the London terraced house and the Manhattan row house schemes; and on the other hand, the structure of the urban grid in each case. The aim is to shed light on the interplay of these two elements, underlining the challenge for any urban design approach: to tackle both buildings and streets along the lines of a unifying and diachronic spatial logic.

Supervised and operated via its members, the components of each institution were tied together through a mode of exchange that prized face-to-face contact, reputation and trust, epitomised by the Stock Exchange motto Dictum Meum Pactum (\u2018My word is my bond\u2019). The latter was made concrete via messenger-operated payment and clearing systems, organised around the hours of trade, provoking the need for proximity between institutions and specific architectural arrangements and resulting in an urban agglomeration of banks and other institutions in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England. The advent of digital technology entailed a decline in the economic significance of pedestrian activity in the City. The shift from manual, paper operations to onscreen transactions made redundant the kinetic network of brokers and messengers that once formed the circulatory system for banking and finance. This paper considers the way in which such shifts ultimately reconfigured the nature of the street as public space and argues that, as fundamental parts of the financial transaction were removed from the City\u2019s thoroughfares, the street would no longer be an extension of the workplace, but a space of leisure.

In recent years, the focus of economic development initiatives has shifted away from supply side initiatives, such as fiscal incentives and the direct provision of premises, towards a consideration of the collective provision of infrastructure and services, in order to meet demands of businesses and workers in cities where there is already strong demand and growth. As well as this shift from supply- to demand-side initiatives, there has been a change in the political ideological approach to land and property development, away from public sector direct provision and funding, to place greater onus on the private sector to deliver development, infrastructure and services. The introduction of \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 planning policies by local authorities in London from the early 2000s is part of this shift \u2013 building on more established key worker and affordable housing policies. This paper evaluates the success of affordable workspace planning policies in thirteen mixed use schemes in London, from the perspectives of developers and workspace providers, who are responsible for delivering and managing the affordable workspace. First, it finds that the perspective of the developer, in particular whether it sees affordable workspace policy as (a) an opportunity, (b) a \u2018tool\u2019 to secure planning permission or (c) a burden, is mostly influenced by the way in which the affordable workspace emerged within the proposal. Developers\u2019 perspectives and the success of their partnerships with workspace providers are critical to the successful delivery of affordable workspace within the scheme. Second, the findings show that \u2018affordable workspace\u2019 is difficult to define and deliver, with different interpretations used by delivery partners and the ability of workspace providers to deliver affordability depends critically on their organisational model. Finally, the research shows that although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, it is not benefiting low-value manufacturers or small family-run retail and service businesses, nor is it generally benefiting start-ups. The implications of policy outcomes for economic development are considered; overall the beneficial impacts are limited. The research concludes that the predominant model of affordable workspace policy being promoted in London will fail to meet the aspirations of policy makers, with the limited success of policy further compounded by the global recession of the late-2000s.

Adopting the hegemonic political and economic theories of Neoliberalism on the general and macro level, and the more specific theories of place marketing on the micro level, this research argues that place marketing is one of the neoliberal imaginaries used to legitimate neoliberal practices, such as Olympic land acquisition. The author connects the abstract theories of Neoliberalism and the concrete theories of place marketing with Sklair\u2019s Transnational Capitalist Class (2001) theory which suggests the formation of globally mobile elites who with their highly mobile capital have become very influential in the staging of urban mega-events and mega projects. In the particular case of the Olympic Games, some of these mobile capitalists have been very active in providing official sponsorship in exchange of exclusive marketing rights to associate their brands with the Olympics. Based on reviews of major Olympic-related official documents, a news survey on national, city and local newspapers and 31 elite interviews covering official place marketers of London, local governments, regional governmental bodies, Olympic Delivery Authority, official Olympic sponsors, small business owners and NGOs, this study points out the conflict of interests between place marketers and product marketers at the junction of urban mega-events. Understanding London\u2019s top world city status and taking into account the desire to host the Olympic Games for a third time in response to fierce inter-city competition, this research indicates how place marketing is in theory a development strategy but in practice a difficult task due to the financial dilemmas and legal issues faced by neoliberalised governments. Legislations passed and contracts signed specifically for the Olympic Games have provided priorities and exclusive rights to official sponsors who are the product marketers in this case over place marketers. This thesis explores the complex legal issues surrounding Olympic place marketing which has a distinct but limited literature, and how localities on different geographical levels are affected by such legal arrangements.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis, full text not available", "Title": "Legitimating London 2012: Urban mega-events and the geography of Olympic place marketing"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c15180b6c192aa80fa5a253ab93d016a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The impact of the Olympic Parkland on the urban heat island", "Project Location - In London": "London Olympic Parkland (51.54615, -0.01269)", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1388917/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/19401493.2013.791343", "Authors": "Ian Hamilton\nStephen Evans\nMichael Davies\nJenny Stocker\nDavid Carruthers", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Jenny Stocker\nDavid Carruthers\nCambridge Environmental Research Consultants Ltd., 3 King\u2019s Parade, Cambridge CB2 1SJ, (52.2042607, 0.1178645)", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "The London Olympic Parkland represents a substantial area of redevelopment with the potential to significantly modify urban temperatures.

However, decision-making involves the everyday life of using and navigating in the built environment to the management of urban space. This paper seeks to understand the basic notion of how pedestrian movement is related to land use choices in the built form. The hypothesis is that movement itself involves a choice; that is, a decision-making of direction and destination, of passing through or of static behaviour. The density of movement flow is seen as a result of locations that potentially become attractors that have a rich distribution of land use. How we accommodate and modulate movement is thus important in helping us understand the multiple effects of everyday use that arises from decision-making processes and its subsequent effectuation in the configuration of urban space. Therefore, two key questions are addressed: first, how the types of movement choices influence and are influenced by the spatial layout; and second, how the distribution of land uses is affected by such choices. The paper uses Space Syntax and Game theory as a combination of theoretical frameworks that study independent and interdependent decision-making processes in urban space, to answer these questions. Taking the River Thames Path as an example, the research project focuses on the unconnected section of the river walk between London Bridge and Southwark Bridge. In analogy with a game of chess, the results demonstrate how different kinds of choices are ruled primarily by the location of commercial uses in the urban grid.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "The Architecture of Decision-Making Processes: A Game of Chess in the Spatial Configuration of the River Thames London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "dac6c7014193dd208400981dca09125e", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Flagship Projects in an Era of Regulatory Capitalism", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2013", "Link": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2427.12025", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1111/1468-2427.12025", "Authors": "Mike Raco", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Much of the urban studies literature on the London Olympics has focused on its social legacies and the top-down nature of policy agendas.

The first five novels each written Le Carr\u00e9 and Deighton were published in the period 1960-1970. Although both authors and these specific works have remained popular in genre spy fiction, there has been little consideration of the works in relation to each other and in their role together in situating the potential threats of the post-war period in a UK domestic setting rather than on mainland Europe. The transition of Fleming\u2019s novels into film starting with \u2018Dr No\u2019 in 1962 suggested that UK spies engaging in espionage undertook this in exotic locations which were far removed from everyday life. An examination of the fiction of Deighton and Le Carr\u00e9 suggests a different world where the locus of external danger was in the suburban midst of Surrey or Wood Green. Whilst the war was over, the British state was still actively defending itself from internal threats and external dangers. The use of specific London locations in these first ten novels \u2013 particularly in \u2018Call for the Dead\u2019, and \u2018The Spy who came in from the Cold\u2019 by Le Carr\u00e9 and \u2018The Ipcress File\u2019 and \u2018Berlin Game\u2019 by Deighton create a language of location and fear. The roles played by the leading characters in these novels are complementary - Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s desk based controllers and Deighton\u2019s operational spies \u2013 and appeal to different audiences many of whom had experience of war or conscription.

I draw from architectural history, feminist and queer theory as well as geographies of sexualities to interrogate the stability of domesticity. Highlighting everyday homemaking practices of more than 40 non-heterosexual households in London, I seek to complicate one overarching regime of power that dominates our cultural value system: heteronormativity \u2013 the idea that normative heterosexuality is the default sexuality to which everyone must conform or declare themselves against. The project is a response to three decades of academic research that has looked at the spatialised ways in which sexual identity unfolds in, for the most part, peripheral zones in the \u2018Western\u2019 metropolis, spaces beyond the domestic realm. This thesis takes a different architectural approach; one where through interviewing 47 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Londoners, as well as eleven domestic tradespeople that work in these homes, agency is given to small-scale domestic interventions and everyday actions. The concept of \u2018queering\u2019 is important to the framework, which, in the context of the thesis, is understood as an on-going process that LGBTQ people are engaged in through homemaking and daily living. Although some participants may not see this as a political act, I argue otherwise and suggest queering at home is a form of political activism. Through mundane domestic actions the overarching structure of heteronormativity might be challenged. I contend that queering the home unfolds in various, complex and conflicting ways. The thesis seeks to provoke both queer theory and politics, by opening up existing approaches and remits to allow room for a domestic method. In addition, the thesis seeks to challenge assumptions within architecture but also in the wider sense.

Instead, it is used performatively and, as such, the politics of public participation involves a struggle between actors over the institutionalisation of particular configurations of social relations around the planning process. It also argues that this struggle is strategic and directed at the achievement of certain planning outcomes, which would be more difficult if another configuration were institutionalised. Therefore, this thesis analyses the storylines of public participation as a significant category of political analysis, and investigates the strategic use of participatory storylines by the GLA planners as they struggled over competing planning agendas. This is conduced also in the context of a variety of interests of other actors that competed against that of the planners during the London Plan making process. The research contributes to an understanding of how planners conceptualise public participation in a variety of innovative ways through performative discursive actions and how they shape planning outcomes by altering existing social relations within planning processes. It also demonstrates how their discursive actions have limited influence in planning institutions with unequal authority positions and how the planning outcomes are seemingly determined by structural forces beyond their control. Social constructivist perspective that focuses on analyzing planners\u2019 personal dynamics helps to highlight the creative ways in which planners deal with and effectively manage competing knowledge, interests and agendas on public participation. It also contributes to clarifying areas of further research in exploring the limits and possibilities that public participation offer to planners within contemporary planning practices.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis, full text not available", "Title": "Discourse Politics of Public Participation: The Role of Planners and the London Plan 2000-2004"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.094755, 51.410583], [-0.109306, 51.445778]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "2b934cc5e44fad2826b9ac66f282aae9", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Migrant social inclusion, and the right to the city", "Project Location - In London": "Spa Hill and Windmills allotment sites (51.410583,-0.094755)\nBrockwell Gardens (51.4457779,-0.1093058)", "Date": "2013", "Link": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13604813.2013.765652", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/13604813.2013.765652", "Authors": "Yves Cabannes\nIsabel Raposo", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Isabel Raposo\nFaculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade Te \u0301cnica de Lisboa (FAUTL)\nFaculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade Te \u0301cnica de Lisboa (FAUTL), (38.7526875, -9.1581875)", "Department": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit (51.524936,-0.130021)", "Abstract": "Two main questions are addressed in this paper, namely: to what extent can urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) contribute to the social inclusion of migrants? And does UPA practised by urban farmers of foreign origin contribute to the expansion of biodiversity in cities? A comparative analysis of current peri-urban agriculture practices in Lisbon and London was carried out in allotment gardens and other spaces far from the centre in and on the edges of these capital cities. In both cases, a significant proportion of the migrant population is involved in two different frameworks: regulated in London and non-regulated in Lisbon. The paper concludes that patterns of social inclusion are quite city specific: urban farming communities from the Cape Verde islands maintain and strengthen community bonds through their activity but this does not necessary lead to better social integration within the wider Portuguese society. In London, migrants of foreign origin become part of an integrated communitarism on an individual basis. Concerning the contribution of peri-urban agriculture to biodiversity, evidence gathered strongly suggests that urban farmers of foreign origin do contribute to broadening biodiversity primarily in Lisbon and to a lesser extent in London. Final observations note to what extent these urban practices contribute to the Right to the City and thus if they are, more broadly, of an emancipatory and transformative nature.", "Partners": "\n", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "\n", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Collaborators", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Other", "Funder 1": "Treaty of Windsor Programme", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Dr. Robert Biel from the Bartlett Development Planning Unit also worked collaboratively on this project.", "Title": "Urban and Peri-urban agriculture, social inclusion of migrant population and right to the city:practices in Lisbon and London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "86b5b7db2494775e553d4ddcfa687301", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Narratives of high street \u2018decline\u2019", "Project Location - In London": "Surbiton (51.394, -0.307)\nSouth Norwood (51.3995, -0.0747)", "Date": "2013", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1418127", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1418127", "Authors": "Sam Griffiths\nAshley Dhanani\nLaura Vaughan\nClaire Ellul\nMuki Haklay\nDavid Jeevendrampillai\nNikolina Nikolova\nPatrick Rickles", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide some much needed theoretical grounding and historical-morphological context for the narratives of communal loss that recur in the reportage concerning the British high street. Given the topicality of this issue for policy-makers it is worth enquiring into precisely how far such narratives are in fact supported by a long-term perspective on historical changes in high street land uses in relation to the evolving spatial morphology of small town centres, in order to better distinguish the extent to which a further layer of socio-cultural explanation is required to account for the concern over \u2018decline\u2019. This research, undertaken as part of the EPSRC Adaptable Suburbs project at UCL, uses fully digitized historical maps, contemporary and historical land use data and space syntax analysis to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in and around two suburban high streets of Greater London since the nineteenth century: Surbiton and South Norwood. Drawing on Hillier and colleagues\u2019 theory of \u2018movement economy, the contemporary English high street, as it is represented in the case-study areas, emerges as a distinctive and resilient spatial morphology which has supported varied modes of land use over time. It concludes that the narrative of high street decline in part reflects a dominant focus on difficulties facing the UK retail sector and that a broader focus on the high street as a (re)generative social space rather than simply as a \u2018retail attractor\u2019 would allow for a broader appreciation of both its morphological and socio-economic capacities.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "EPSRC  EP/I001212/1", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Using space syntax and historical land-use data to interrogate narratives of high street \u2018decline\u2019 in two Greater London suburbs"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "db0a96fecd99978cf433ac9cba16703c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Adaptation to change in street network: 1880-2013", "Project Location - In London": "Surbiton (51.394, -0.307)\nSouth Norwood (51.3995, -0.0747)", "Date": "2013", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1417189", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1417189", "Authors": "Laura Vaughan\nAshley Dhanani\nSam Griffiths  ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "This article addresses the question of how the fringes of cities develop spatially at both the local scale of the individual town centre and in relation to the wider urban network. The changing network structure of the street systems of two outer suburban areas of Greater London, Surbiton and South Norwood, are analysed from the 1880s onwards. A temporal reading of the process of urban growth in relation to the historic street network of local centres allows for a nuanced understanding of the way in which cities grow over time. Rather than conceptualising suburban growth as either a seeding of new territories in tabula rasa or a \u2018swallowing-up\u2019 of older settlements, this article argues for a measured description of the spatial, social and economic properties of urban grid intensification. This research uses digitised historical maps, historical and contemporary land-use data together with space syntax analysis in order to identify historical-morphological parameters of change and continuity in London\u2019s suburban street network from the 1880s. The analysis demonstrates that over the period of time considered there have been distinct stages in the spatial development of the city\u2019s urban fringe. The results show that as London expanded to encircle new territories, the spatial relationships of fringe areas of the city changed markedly as larger scale infrastructure was built and local development intensified, with the effect of reconfiguring the local network of the case study suburbs. However, detailed analysis of the formation of suburban town centres using space syntax also uncovers distinctive and resilient spatial morphologies which have sustained varied modes of land use over time. Drawing on the theory of the urban \u2018movement economy\u2019 and our previous research in this area, the article shows how the complex balance of change and continuity realised in the spatial morphology of the suburban high street can be explained by complex scalar mechanisms of adaptability. We argue that these qualities have helped ensure the resilience of historical suburban centres even in the face of radical social change.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "EPSRC  EP/I001212/1", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "This article is part of the Adaptable Suburbs project which also include researchers: \nVictor Buchili, Mordechai (Muki) Haklay, Claire Ellul, Patrick Rickles, and David Jeevendrampillai.", "Title": "Beyond the suburban high street clich\u00e9 - A study of adaptation to change in London\u2019s street network: 1880-2013"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "3f60a90ef0a35ffc40728c7cf5a8a509", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Microbial Risk in Flooded Dwellings", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1378606", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1378606", "Authors": "Jonathon Taylor", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "Abstract": "With a changing climate, London is expected to experience more frequent periods of intense rainfall and tidal surges, which will lead to an increase in the risk of flooding. Floodwater may deposit harmful microorganisms on building surfaces, while damp indoor environments in flooded dwellings can support the growth of microorganisms including mould, bacteria, and protozoa. This thesis investigates possible flood-borne and damp-related pathogens in flooded London dwellings, and the potential duration of microbial contamination risk following a flood event. Microbiological laboratory work and models are used to characterise microbial risk within flooded dwellings. Dwelling archetypes representative of the London housing stock are developed and hygrothermal simulation techniques used to model the flooding and drying behaviour of the archetypes under different scenarios in order to predict the duration of damp and microbial risk inside typical dwellings. The results of the combined biological and hygrothermal models are mapped alongside existing flood risk maps in order to predict areas in London susceptible to long-term microbial risk or prolonged displacement following a flood. Highlights of the research findings include the following (i) The persistence of bacterial contaminants on flooded materials is related to the type of floodwater, the drying conditions including temperature and drying rate, and the material drying characteristics, ii) Different dwellings in London have different drying behaviours due to their built form and dominant wall types, with modern purpose-built flats the most prone to long-term damp and microbial risk following a flood event, (iii) The flood height, external weather, and internal conditions including heating and ventilation can have a major impact on the length of time a dwelling will remain at risk of microbial contamination, and (iv) The concentration of properties vulnerable to long-term microbial exposure following major flood events is highest in areas of South and East London, particularly Southwark.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "Funder 2": "EPSRC: EP/G029881/1, PE/F007132/1", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Predicting the Microbial Risk in Flooded London Dwellings Using Microbial, Hygrothermal, and GIS Modelling"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a0c68c747acca309a719c95c95f0887c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Building characteristics and high indoor summer temperatures", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2011", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1360983/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.12.003", "Authors": "Anna Mavrogianni\nMichael Davies\nPhillip Biddulph\nEleni Oikonomou\nPaul Wilkinson", "London Authors": "Paul Wilkinson\nLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, WC1H 9SH, (51.5254495, -0.1266846)\n\nMichael Davies\nPhillip Biddulph\nBartlett School of Graduate Studies\nCentral House, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN\n(51.52691197043194, -0.1298238153986028)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "Abstract": "Cities are expected to experience an increasing risk of overheating due to climate change and the urban heat island phenomenon. Although external factors, such as urban morphology and greening, may influence the spatio-temporal variation of overheating risk, the individual building characteristics are also likely to be important. This paper presents the results of EnergyPlus dynamic thermal simulations of 3456 combinations of dwelling types and characteristics selected to represent the London domestic stock. Two Design Summer Year weather files were used to represent the current and future climate: the CIBSE 1984\u20132004 and a UKCP09 future weather file (50th percentile of external temperature, 2050s, medium emissions scenario). Appreciable variation between dwelling types but generally greater variation within dwelling type was found depending on such factors as orientation, surrounding buildings and insulation levels. Under the current climate, the insulation levels had considerable impact on indoor temperatures, with combined retrofitting of roof insulation and window upgrades reducing daytime living room temperatures during the warmest continuous 5-day period of modelling by, on average, 0.76 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.63, 0.89 \u00b0C) for mean temperature and 1.30 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 1.05, 1.54 \u00b0C) for maximum temperature. On the other hand, internally retrofitted walls and floors tended to increase daytime living room temperatures, with a combined effect of 0.46 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.33, 0.60 \u00b0C) increase in mean temperature and 0.71 \u00b0C (%95C.I. 0.47, 0.96) increase in maximum temperature.

Identifying the determinant factors for energy demand and thermal comfort across a city is hence a key requirement for energy efficient retrofit and public health strategies. The aim of this thesis was to assess the relative impact of urban warming, built form and fabric characteristics on domestic energy use and overheating risk across a major city, using London as a case study. Two housing stock models were developed: a heat demand model based on steady-state energy use calculation techniques and a multiple linear regression overheating risk meta-model of an existing dynamic thermal simulation program. Input data was derived from existing Geographic Information System databases, national housing surveys and local urban air temperature models. The heat demand model successfully reproduced the ranking of urban areas based on their actual gas consumption (R\u00b2 = 0.817) in a case study area containing 8.6% of London's dwelling stock. The heat island was found to decrease the average annual domestic heating load by 14% in these urban areas compared to a rural reference site. It was shown that the overheating meta-model can replicate the output of the thermal simulation program (R\u00b2 = 0.763). It was indicated that highly exposed dwelling types, such as top floor flats and bungalows, as well as internally insulated buildings are likely to present an indoor overheating problem during periods of hot weather. However, the agreement between modelled overheating levels and monitored data collected in 101 London homes in summer 2009 was relatively weak, thus highlighting the modifying role of occupant controlled ventilation for indoor thermal conditions.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis, full text not available", "Title": "Modelling domestic space heating demand and heat wave vulnerability within the London urban heat island"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "1850fc491a3dac477a9130887b8c85a9", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Planning for markets", "Project Location - In London": "Camden (51.541, -0.1433)", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1344161", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1344161", "Authors": "Rosita Aiesha", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest amongst policy makers in the market\u2019s potential role in contributing to solutions in key social and economic public policy agendas. In particular, Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres suggests that markets have a role to play in revitalising town centres and offering retail choice. To date, very little is known about the contemporary relevance of markets and specifically why markets have been prioritised in retail planning policy and received public policy interest. This paper investigates these issues further. Through a literature review, it develops a conceptual and contextual framework for understanding markets. It then draws on empirical research, i.e. survey and interview data from a study of London boroughs and a case study of one London Local Authority (Camden), to highlight the effects of current day-to-day management and planning approaches in sustaining markets. The research demonstrates that the contemporary role of the market is multidimensional, e.g. they appear to play significant roles as managed public space but also act as an important social and economic space, particularly for marginal social groups. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that, whilst proactive planning policies do not guarantee a vibrant market, they can play a key part in protecting their permanent loss; however, equally important is the supportive management approaches taken in shaping their social survival. The research findings have relevance for the theorisation of markets in a contemporary context, as well as implications for the practical effects of planning policy intervention on markets.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Planning for markets: understanding the role of planning policy and management approaches in sustaining markets in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "e8c10e049db4e69c342094c55e9827d0", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "East London Tech City (51.5257, -0.0875)", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10175207/1/Tale-of-tech-city.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10175207/1/Tale-of-tech-city.pdf", "Authors": "Max Nathan (The author produced the paper before joining Bartlett)\nEmma Vandore\nRob Whitehead", "London Authors": "Emma Vandore\nn/a\n\nRob Whitehead\nCentre for London, SE1 4YB, (51.5009271, -0.0921452)\n\nMax Nathan\nSpatial Economics Research Centre, London School of Economics, London WC2A 2AE (51.51361050312227, -0.11666715957567746)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "This report maps the development of \u2018Silicon Roundabout\u2019, and provides a detailed account of the firms and jobs that make up the cluster.

Improvements are made on existing empirical measures by providing comprehensive intra-metropolitan analysis; increasing network routing accuracy with UK public transport timetable and GPS-based average road speed data; allowing multimodal travel; and developing metrics suitable for travel sustainability analysis. The output unit of CO2 emissions has been selected to enable the integration of mode-choice and travel distance data, and to aid compatibility with integrated assessment applications. The methodology is applied to the case study of the London Region for the year 2001. A very high degree of intra-metropolitan variation is identified in the results.

It attempts to correct the misunderstandings in Marxian land rent theory and develop it for an urban context. The four categories of land rent of differential rent, differential rent 2, absolute rent, and monopoly rent are critically re-examined. Subsequently, the combination of absolute rent and differential rent is suggested as a general structure for land rents in an urban context. The dynamic mechanism of changes in land rents is explained with the concepts of emulation, differentiation and shift between groups of houses based on the structure of land rents. The process of the formation of housing submarkets has been examined for a practical preparation for empirical analysis and a theoretical basis for the subdivision of the housing market. Spatial submarkets are identified by focusing on the interactive relationship between residential spheres (a unit consisting of a centre of employment and the surrounding residential area). Sectoral submarkets are defined based on social and environmental features as well as the structural features of dwellings. For empirical analysis, three metropolitan cities were chosen: London as monocentric, Seoul as tri-centric and Los Angeles as polycentric. Empirical analysis has used commuting patterns and the contours of house prices as the criteria to identify spatial submarkets with the help of network analysis and GIS. Simple OLS regression analysis of house prices on the accessibility to centre was conducted in each identified submarket. The results were used to explore the structure of and the dynamic changes in land rents. A consistent structure of land rents was observed in each housing submarket across all three cities. The implication on the condition of labour reproduction was drawn out by interpreting the changes in land rents over a period of 10 years in each city. The analysis of London revealed a monocentric housing market structure and the suitability of commuting time over physical distance as an accessibility variable. In Seoul\u201fs case, the transition from tri-centric to monocentric housing market was observed and a comparative approach with rent and price data enriched the interpretation of the changes in the structure of the housing market. The impact of social and environmental features of the neighbourhood, such as class, ethnic concentration and negative externality, on house prices was highlighted in the analysis of Los Angeles.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Data support", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Spatial analysis of housing markets with land rent theory of political economy: the cases of London, Seoul and Los Angeles"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [[-0.015256, 51.550395]]}, "properties": {"UUID": "6f891e7441cfca17f774826b701763a6", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Urban Water-cycle in the Lower Lea River Basin", "Project Location - In London": "Lower Lea river basin (51.550395,-0.015256)", "Date": "2011", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1336876", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1336876", "Authors": "Tse-Hui Teh (produced this thesis when in the Faculty of Engineering)", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "This thesis explores how water infrastructures can be reconfigured in the urban environment to the advantage of human society in the future. It found actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways between current material configurations and social practices for these reconfigurations. Material configurations include infrastructures, urban form, fixtures, fittings, and water types. Social practices, include existing behaviours, imagined behaviours, desires, and aspirations. This is an important question to answer because there are many places around the world, both in developed and developing countries that currently face inadequate water supplies to serve the needs of their ever growing populations, or conversely flooding due to extreme precipitation or sea level rise. The lower Lea river basin in London is one such area. The large scale engineering solutions of pipes and pumps to control water that have been the typical solution are reaching their limits therefore it is imperative to find other means to manage water in urban environments. This research used an actor-network theory co-evolution framework to understand the existing urban water-cycle, and to find areas of transformation in order to develop actor-network co-evolutionary pathways for change. Interviews, group discussions and water diaries were used to investigate the existing conditions and anticipated future changes of both private citizens and water professionals. An iterative process of design synthesis and discussions were repeated twice to test and define the actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways. This research stretches actor-network theory from its ethnographic beginnings into the realm of the future through design propositions. It found that there were two strongly favoured actor-network theory co-evolutionary pathways for reconfiguring the urban water-cycle in the lower Lea river basin. These were increasing freshwater productivity and transforming waste to resource. These create new water-cycle assemblages that offer advantages to people who face many, yet uncertain, types of water stress in the future.", "Partners": "Local participants", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Hydro-Urbanism: Reconfiguring the Urban Water-cycle in the Lower Lea River Basin, London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "e7e4e52fbbf8ccbc2b7bbb76ac359bb3", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Public engagement with water conservation", "Project Location - In London": "Hackney (51.55, -0.058333)\nTower Hamlets (51.516667, -0.05)\nNewham (51.516667, 0.033333) \nWaltham Forest (51.566667, -0.033333)\nHarringey (51.601632, -0.112915)", "Date": "2011", "Link": "https://discovery-pp.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/150356/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1111/j.1747-6593.2011.00256.x", "Authors": "Tse-Hui Teh (now in the Bartlett School of Planning), Sarah Bell (now in BSEER), (they produced this work when in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering)\nUd Doron\nMuki Haklay", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Understanding water demand and consumers' capacity for change is essential in underpinning water demand management and water efficiency programmes.

In London, planning authorities are developing policies based on the affordable housing model that require developers of mixed-use schemes on land previously in employment use, to include an amount of \u2018affordable workspace\u2019. This research examines policy objectives and outcomes of thirteen mixed-use schemes with affordable workspace across London, with a particular focus on the London Borough of Hackney, which has been using planning gain to implement affordable workspace since 2003. The perspectives of the three main stakeholders are considered; the planning authority, the developer and the workspace provider. The research reveals that the motivations for affordable workspace policies are more about promoting economic development \u2013 in particular either protecting or promoting creative industry clusters \u2013 than promoting social equity or sustainability. To ascertain whether policy is addressing the problem, the case studies explore the factors influencing the success of schemes, the difficulty of defining and delivering \u2018affordability\u2019, whether the causes of the problem are being tackled, and who are the winners and losers. The impact of policy on economic development, city vibrancy, social equity and sustainability is analysed. The policy\u2019s contribution to job creation, cluster formation and economic diversity is explored with reference to local and regional objectives. The research shows that, although there are clear benefits of the policy for artists and small, creative industry businesses, there are problems of industrial gentrification, the plight of lower-value businesses, and homogenous developments that contribute little to the economic or social diversity of the area.

Contemporary world cities are characterised by high levels of economic specialisation between intra-urban centres, an expanding regional scope, and market-led processes of development. These issues have been given relatively little attention in sustainable travel research, yet are increasingly defining urban structures, and need to be much better understood if improvements to urban transport sustainability are to be achieved. London has been argued to be the core of a polycentric urban region, and currently there is mixed evidence on the various sustainability and efficiency merits of more decentralised urban forms. The focus of this research is to develop analytical tools to investigate the links between urban economic geography and transportation sustainability; and apply these tools to the case study of the London region. An innovative methodology for the detailed spatial analysis of urban form, employment geography and transport sustainability is developed for this research, with a series of new application of GIS and spatial data to urban studies. Firstly an intra-metropolitan scale of spatial analysis is pursued, allowing both an extensive regional scope and a sufficiently intensive local level of detail to analyse the decentralisation processes described above. Secondly a series of detailed spatial datasets are introduced to analyse employment geography and dynamics, including business survey data and fine-scale real-estate data. For the measurement of accessibility, detailed network analysis and congestion data is used. Finally for the assessment of transportation sustainability, an indicator of CO2 emissions at intra-urban scales is developed, and is calculated for the 6.5 million journey-to-work trips in the study region. The results highlight extreme intra-urban variation in accessibility, employment geography and travel carbon emissions with clear relevance to urban form and sustainable travel debates in the London region.", "Partners": "1.

They are more than structures contrived from planned associations amongst industry professionals. Instead, a building involves processes of engagement amongst different groups, technologies, materials and methods. It is these processes of socio-techno engagement which contribute to the uptake of the sustainability agenda, and in turn can create sustainability effects. The following research sets out problems associated with the traditional staged approach to development and conceptualisations of building sustainability as an output. It proposes instead a network approach as a conceptual framework for understanding processes of socio-techno network engagements with the sustainability agenda. To this end, three research questions are presented: one empirical, one analytical and one conceptual, each of which focuses on the application of a network approach to the study of urban development and the uptake of the sustainability agenda. The network approach adopted draws on key facets of Actor-network Theory and Social Network Analysis. A qualitative methodology is employed to investigate a case study London sustainable prime commercial building process: the PricewaterhouseCoopers new headquarters development, 7 More London. Analysis of interview data is coded and mapped using ATLAS.ti software. Empirical research focuses on identification of social and technical actors involved in building networks, and understanding the mobilisers and intents of their actions. There is also an explicit focus on boundary objects: how common objects and objectives, and translations of them, effectively facilitate and delimit engagement both in the development process and with the sustainability agenda. 5 key findings emerge from detailed analysis which collectively help answer the research questions and raises some new questions of their own.

Tower Hamlets, a borough in East London was experiencing similar trends and with the contribution of initiatives and policies from Central Government the Idea Stores concept was born. These innovative and modern new learning centos were designed to replace the old, out dated library services the borough had previously had and were built to be community focal points, providing not just books as is the traditional stereotype of libraries but offering computer and internet facilities, educational classes for all ages, cafes, creches and relaxing atmospheres for all members of society. They were built to stand out from surrounding buildings with new designs catching the eye of passers by. There are currently four Idea Stores that have been completed and running for several years with a further three to be built and open in the near future. It is the four that have been opened that this research project will investigate. It will also look at the issues facing the country's library facilities and investigate the ways the Idea Stores have sort to change the public perception of libraries as old, formal and in some cases intimidating facilities to welcoming, relaxed and enjoyable institutions. The conclusions are that overall the Idea Stores have been successful in attracting visitors to use the facilities and the take up of services such as educational classes and internet terminals has been very high. The only concerns were that the overall rebranding of the Idea Store name rather than the term library has led to confusion about what the facility is for and a cessation of advertising after the first two Idea Stores opened has also posed a problem.", "Partners": "visitors and managers at Idea Store", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "A consideration of the success of the Idea Stores in improving library and learning services in the London borough of Tower Hamlets"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "69ef78b1ed96d63296407cb9087e747a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Neurological symptoms and CO emissions from problem gas appliance installations", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2007", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/9318/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1186/1476-069X-7-34", "Authors": "Ben Croxford\nGiovanni S Leonardi\nIrene Kreis", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Giovanni S Leonardi\nChemical Hazards & Poisons Division, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Health Protection Agency, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon, OX11 0RQ, UK, (51.5754849, -1.3180554)\n\nIrene Kreis\nChemical Hazards & Poisons Division, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Health Protection Agency, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon, OX11 0RQ, UK, (51.5754849, -1.3180554)\n\nUniversity of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2533, Australia, (-34.4079569, 150.8771350)\n3.

The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure.Methods: Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with high or very high exposure category where occupants were considered likely to be exposed to levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure.Results: Of the households, 6% were assessed as having a high or very high risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9% reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between high or very high exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to no exposure likelihood, for households not in receipt of benefit, controlling for number of residents and presence of pensioners, OR = 3.23 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in receipt of benefit showed no dose-response pattern.Conclusion: This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in receipt of benefit. As health status was self-reported, this association requires further investigation.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "\n\n", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "Government", "Policy source subcategory": "UK Parliament Select Committee Publications", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Research Support ", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "Self-reported neurological symptoms in relation to CO emissions due to problem gas appliance installations in London: a cross-sectional survey"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "dd59ee59dec6432bd1de88effc63b2b4", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Scaling and allometry in the building geometries", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2007", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/15179", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/15179", "Authors": "Michael Batty\nRui Carvalho\nAndy Hudson-Smith\nRichard Milton\nDuncan Smith\nPhilip Steadman", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "Many aggregate distributions of urban activities such as city sizes reveal scaling but hardly any work exists on the properties of spatial distributions within individual cities, notwithstanding considerable knowledge about their fractal structure. We redress this here by examining scaling relationships in a world city using data on the geometric properties of individual buildings. We first summarise how power laws can be used to approximate the size distributions of buildings, in analogy to city-size distributions which have been widely studied as rank-size and lognormal distributions following Zipf [Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort (Addison-Wesley, Cambridge, 1949)] and Gibrat [Les Inegalites Economiques (Librarie du Recueil Sirey, Paris, 1931)]. We then extend this analysis to allometric relationships between buildings in terms of their different geometric size properties. We present some preliminary analysis of building heights from the Emporis database which suggests very strong scaling in world cities. The data base for Greater London is then introduced from which we extract 3.6 million buildings whose scaling properties we explore. We examine key allometric relationships between these different properties illustrating how building shape changes according to size, and we extend this analysis to the classification of buildings according to land use types.

LSPs were set up to establish inclusive, collaborative and strategic approach at the local level. The main tasks of LSPs are to establish the Community Strategy, the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy and the areas of allocation of the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund with aims of reflecting local needs are for neighbourhood renewals. Because LSP consists of various stakeholders in various policy areas at different administrative levels, it would be difficult to reach agreements among them and to produce tangible output. This thesis explores preconditions of the LSPs approaches, two-way communications for formulating strategies, reaching consensus between members of LSPs and reflecting local needs to such strategies, and contributions to local communities. Then, it discusses what forces determine styles of operation of LSPs, why LSPs encounter difficulties in discussions in the decision making process and why LSPs have difficulties in shaping strategies of the partners' organisations. Firstly, this thesis develops a new evaluation framework for the strategies-making programme and public participation programmes, which may find practical use, based on the literature reviews of both academic research papers and government guidance on participative planning approach. Secondly, through reviews of government guidance on LSP approaches, this thesis established hypotheses for resolving the above mentioned questions by considering the new evaluation framework. Thirdly, in order to verify hypotheses, it uses the results of a questionnaire survey, a one-year observation of the board meetings, and an interview survey which examines the ways that the process operated for the strategy-making in four LSPs in inner London boroughs namely, Camden, Hackney, Lambeth and Wandsworth. It concludes by discussing to extent which LSPs achieve involvement and success in shaping the strategies of the partners.", "Partners": "Participants from these 4 LSPs", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Local Strategic Partnerships in London: an investigation of local collaborative action"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "e811d25fe85389d75f6f051655cd6829", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Environmentally Sustainable Construction in planning", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2007", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10765/1/Rydin_81275_PTP%20254-05%20subedited.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/14649350701514686", "Authors": "Yvonne Rydin\nUrooj Amjad\nMartine Whitaker", "London Authors": "1.

Following a literature review, and some definitions of the subject matter, there is an analysis of transport data, including the historic use of motorcycles, and policy documents at a national, regional and local level informs a discussion on the utility of motorcycles within a sustainable transport strategy, and its implementation by London Boroughs. As well as examining travel patterns in London, the thesis details the characteristics of London motorcyclists and what differentiates them from riders elsewhere in the UK. The thesis considers some issues associated with the use of motorcycles that help inform policy and strategy at both the national and the local level. These include safety, emissions, noise, congestion and use of the road space. These issues are then tested through case studies of policies and strategies produced by two the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Harrow. The final section compares the characteristics of motorcycles against the requirements of a sustainable transport system and summarises the positive and negative contributions that motorcycles can make. This thesis attempts to answer the questions: Do motorcycles represent a more sustainable transport mode than the private car in Greater London Could an increase in motorcycle use, at the expense of either car or public transport use, have a significant impact on the sustainability of transport in London Would encouraging motorcycle use present a more sustainable approach to London overall, in terms of secondary environmental measures What role can land-use planning have in assisting motorcycle use The thesis concludes that motorcycles do have a role to play in helping to achieve a more sustainable transport system in London, but this is to some extent, dependent on the type and location of journey the vehicle is used for. The thesis also concludes that increasing motorcycle use would be beneficial to motorcyclists' road safety, and how motorcycling would be a beneficiary of policies intended to reduce car use.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "The contribution motorcycles can make to sustainable transport in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "50c36c0a8cc7018ea6f42a4f0876ab1c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Ecological footprints as a policy driver", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2007", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10184003/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/13549830601098198", "Authors": "Susan Moore\u00a0\nMichael Nye\u00a0\nYvonne Rydin", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Susan Moore \nCardiff School of City and Regional Planning Cardiff University, CF10 3AT, (51.4890135, -3.1797175)\n\nMichael Nye\nCentre for Environmental Risk University of East Anglia, NR4 7TJ, (52.6223937, 1.2414116)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "The heuristic value of the ecological footprint (EF) conceptual device has met with considerable political and civic buy-in at national, regional and local levels.

Furthermore, through the application of the latest segment angular techniques, space syntax analysis reveals a new finding relating to the formation of poverty areas, which combine low integration with large numbers of small street blocks, suggesting that this combination of spatial factorshelps explain the persistence of poverty and poor quality housing, detrimental to the living standards of the poverty classes. This finding also helps explain how such areas can create a sense of entering \\'another world\\', with the emergence of sub-cultures and new communities.

The research is led by interviews with a Planning Partner of a large national consultancy based in London specialising in major retail development, a Senior Strategic Planner in the GLA responsible for town centre issues, and the Assistant Director in charge of planning in an inner London borough. Along with other forms of qualitative research, these reveal problems in the conceptual basis of metropolitan retail planning decision taking. This particularly relates to the level of consideration given by planners to the desired organisation of town centre networks. It is found that due to this, the potential 'strategic advantage' of retail coordination at the regional level cannot at present materialise in the metropolis. In contrast local planning authorities, if their capacity is increased, can at least recognise aspects of the possible role of town centres that retail planning has not fully appreciated.", "Partners": "the West End Partner (WEP) at the major planning consultancy\nthe Senior Strategic Planner (SSP) at the GLA\nthe Assistant Director (AD) in charge of planning at Hammersmith & Fulham council ", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Should major redevelopment in London town centres be more regionally orchestrated or locally led?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "aa6e276ead5273a1a803249331a60e53", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The answer and barriers to estate renewal", "Project Location - In London": "Woodberry Down estate (51.5728114, -0.1000159), N4", "Date": "2006", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1569405", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1569405", "Authors": "Thomas W B Bridgman", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "High density, mixed tenure policy is influencing development throughout the country. In London, it is beginning to shape estate renewal delivery practices, with the buoyant housing market utilised to deliver the cross subsidy needed to rebuild ailing social housing provision. The Mayor's London Plan is pushing for a more compact city, which along with the 50% target for all housing development to be 'affordable' is also serving to push proposed densities on estate renewal schemes higher. Related to this is the concept of mixing communities to achieve a critical mass of social change and alleviate so called negative 'area effects'. While a range of policy goals are suggested in the pursuit of such policies, the government has not been explicit in setting clear objectives against which policy delivery can be tested. This dissertation analyses current research into high density and mixed tenure development. It seeks to better understand the impacts when the two outcomes are combined in the London context. Six case studies taken from current research are analysed against the proposed Woodberry Down estate renewal scheme, one of a number of emerging redevelopment projects based on emerging delivery practices towards high density, mixed tenure communities. A range of barriers to effective implementation are identified, which could impact upon identified goals. The reality is that as pressure grows to deliver more housing and facilities, with less land and government subsidy, these barriers will be traded off each other by local politicians in the hope of achieving the best possible outcome under increasingly difficult circumstances. Key to this is the need to engender strong local leadership, public sector control, a proactive planning system and economic viability, both in terms of initial scheme costs and longer term management.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Is mixed tenure, high density housing the answer to estate renewal in London?

Urban design, applied with the aim of enhancing a sense of place, may also be particularly important in the traditionally 'placeless' suburban context. Following the 2004 Planning and Compensation Act, urban design frameworks began to emerge for suburban town centres in London. They are important and demand analysis, because they represent modern urban design in London moving beyond the city core into mixed-use suburban areas. Any analysis of this phenomenon must also include awareness of the implications of the London Plan, setting as it does the strategic planning context for all suburban design frameworks. Three differing case study design frameworks were selected for detailed investigation. In most cases, micro-scale design objectives within the study area were well-formulated. However, issues relating to their wider context often appeared problematic, notably the frameworks' relationship with neighbouring centres, enhancement of local distinctiveness, and their attitude towards environmental sustainability. With the relatively monocentric London Plan ignoring the important potential contribution of London's suburbs to city-region growth and sustainability, the regional planning context thus generated encourages the pariochiality highlighted within the case study design frameworks. A realignment of regional policy, particularly the formulation of strategic design goals, might offer suburban town centres more opportunity to contribute to London's growth and sustainability. According to case study evidence, such realignment should incorporate promotion of orbital public transport corridors, coordination of complementary or 'niche' roles for town centres enhancing any existing local sense of place, and top-down integration of environmental sustainability from regional to local level. This new strategic planning and design context might represent an achievable first stage towards a more sustainable, polycentric pattern of development for London.", "Partners": "Stewart Clark of the London Borough of Bromley, \nBrian Hodge and Paul Garrett of the London Borough of Merton and \nMurray Broad of the London Borough of Redbridge.", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Deficiencies in urban design policy for suburban town centres in London: Is strategic design the answer?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "9fbbbe432ad622ad58880c928172d80a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "What if? the next London Plan were better?", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2006", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1732", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1732", "Authors": "Michael Edwards", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "The paper presents a critique of procedures and substance in the London Plan, summarising and extending evidence the author was invited to give to the Examination in Public of the Plan.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "", "Title": "What if? the next London Plan were better?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "f8f0a0c31a6fd348db6c881ff7839660", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "1988-2003: A study of housing management and cultural change", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2006", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1444966", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1444966", "Authors": "Tony Manzi", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "This thesis investigates management change in housing associations in London since the Housing Act of 1988. Previous work on housing management has tended to focus on the adoption of new public management principles, assuming that policy from 1988 has resulted in a cultural shift towards individualism. This study makes use of 'grid-group' cultural theory to challenge this assumption by tracking all four 'cultures' within housing association management: egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism as well as individualism. As a detailed qualitative analysis of the voluntary housing sector, it addresses a neglected field of study within public policy. London provides rich ground for analysis of cultural change in the voluntary housing sector. It has a higher concentration of housing associations than any other UK city, it is where most of the larger housing organisations originated and it is the site of the greatest development activity throughout the period. London housing associations encapsulate all the significant changes in housing management resulting from the reforms of the 1980s. Whilst the study finds evidence of individualistic philosophy, particularly amongst senior housing association managers, it also finds evidence of egalitarianism, hierarchalism and fatalism. Egalitarianism remains as the legacy of housing associations' historical origins and organisational structures. Hierarchy results from an increasingly dominant role for a small number of large, elite organisations, which become more hierarchical as they grow. Fatalism has emerged as a prevalent ethos amongst front-line staff, reflected and reinforced by the increasingly negative experience of residents. The thesis reveals how, contrary to the expectations of the 1988 Act, an overall shift 'up-grid' towards hierarchalism and fatalism emerged as the most significant response.", "Partners": "48 local participants", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Social Sciences and Humanities", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "PhD thesis", "Title": "Individualism, egalitarianism, hierarchy and fatalism in London housing associations, 1988-2003: A study of housing management and cultural change"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "7d4c5b51ee0dc003b158649f2686b53b", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Public participation in urban regeneration", "Project Location - In London": "Spitalfields, east London, 51.5166, -0.075", "Date": "2005", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1566900", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1566900", "Authors": "Andrew Barron", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Community participation in urban regeneration has advanced significantly since the Skeffington report was published over 35 years ago.

New institutional landscapes are being formed across London and power is increasingly diffused across multiple sectors under a new multi-level network pattern of governance. The new institutional arrangements for London and the inauguration of the Greater London Authority in particular embody the contradictory New Labour modernisation agenda displaying evidence of centralism, managerialism and localism at the same time (Brooks, 1999). In London Thames Gateway the omnipresence of the central state is revealed despite the 'devolution' of power to a new citywide Mayor. This also suggests that Government is increasingly being 'hollowed-out' (Houghton and Counsell, 2004) but that central Government continues to 'steer' the course. If the last few years are anything to go by spatial planning and strategic planning projects in particular, are back in vogue. As in the post-war period London is faced with a projected population and jobs explosion, although for very different reasons. 'Big bang' strategic planning has returned with a vengeance but for London Thames Gateway the same old questions remain: delivery---how, who and where The current institutional apparatus continues to confuse and bemuse and this study is about contributing towards the task of converting paper plans and a multitude of competing urban visions into lived reality. A broader reconfiguration of the state, economy and civil society means that a more sophisticated understanding is required to get to grips with the different actors involved within networks and the relationships of these networks. In the context of institutional fragmentation London Thames Gateway is used as a 'window' into the current institutional framework to see how the New Labour modernisation agenda is working 'on the ground'. The study uses semi-structured interviews across the various governance tiers (i.e. central Government, pan-London and sub-regional levels) to analyse the internal and external working relationships of the various actors involved. The analysis suggests that for those organisations involved in London Thames Gateway there is a 'sense of a widely-held common project' (Amin and Thrift 1995) and that this is the 'institutional glue' that binds these organisations together. In this sense the study draws on anthropology by isolating typologies or generic characteristics to understand what binds (or not) these institutions together. The evidence also suggests that participation in developing an urban vision for London Thames Gateway has broadened to encompass sectors (such as the health sector) previously neglected in planning processes and this is a positive aspect of the reforms. In an analysis of the proposed Urban Development Corporation a number of positive (generic) components can be identified. However, the analysis also emphasises that the New Labour modernisation programme is likely to generate significant tensions and some of these are in evidence in London Thames Gateway. This is because the many changes and innovations that result from this programme are creating new institutional arrangements and there is evidence of competing cultures as emerging institutions bring with them a whole new set of values and rules-in-use. These new governance structures can be linked to London's position within the global economy, the 'flavour' of the new planning system and the spatial plans being produced to take account of these trends. The global economic race for economic competitiveness dictates that planners and planning must respond, whilst at the same time steering a course through social cohesion and environmental sustainability. It is argued that there is no spatial fait accompli and political institutions and civil society in London Thames Gateway are able to manoeuvre to steer these forces in a positive direction. And so, the broader of role of planners and their ability to deliver through these emerging institutional mechanisms is brought into question. In so doing we argue that this has forced them to cast aside traditional working practices and to develop new approaches to ensuring economic, environmental and social objectives are met through the prism of spatial planning.", "Partners": "\nInterview a -Greater London Authority (GLA)\nInterview b \u2014Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) Interview c \u2014Mayor s Office\nInterview d -Greater London Authority (GLA)\nInterview e - Thames Gateway London Partnership (TGLP)", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Visions of delivery: Institutional capacity, governance and spatial planning in London Thames gateway"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a5f15e9f5bca3f1c98b06e21500067f1", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Deleuze, cinema and the London Underground", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2004", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1444758", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1444758", "Authors": "Marko Jobst", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "This thesis addresses the London Underground in the light of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of cinema. The first chapter gives an overview of the aspects of Deleuze's philosophy, which are of particular interest in the context of architectural theory. The main postulates of transcendental empiricism are explained, followed by the four major concepts: space, time, image and event. The second chapter deals with Deleuze's understanding of the cinematic frame. The relationship between the frame and the content of framing is shown as possibly inherently dynamic. A description of the major points regarding the Underground corridor follows, with the explanation of the condition of the walking body and its relation to the surrounds. Finally, the notion of the cinematic frame and acts of framing are utilised for the conceptualisation of the Underground corridor, showing the notion of movement to be of crucial importance. Chapter three regards the platform event in relation to the cinematic shot, which is explained to be a matter of conversion of movement. The specificity of the Underground platform is related, and the relationship between the body and the moving object of the train explained. The conjunction between the platform and the shot is then proposed, to show that the platform stands at a point of conversion of movement, transforming body's relationship to its environment. Chapter four is the discussion of the Underground carriage, and its understanding in the light of Deleuze's conceptualisation of the cinematic close-up. The close-up is shown to represent a specific, qualitative transformation, which marks the shift of movement in the direction of expression. The concept of any-space-whatever is then related as an example of Deleuze's transformation of the close-up of the face to the object and then to a spatial figure. The specifics of the Underground carriage are related, introducing the notion of the motionless body inside a moving confinement, as well as the presentation of 'facialisation.' The third part of the chapter sees the explanation of the carriage event in the light of the close-up/affection-image, and it pays special attention to the transformation of movement into expression. Finally, Chapter Five sees the discussion of the Underground in general, and its relation to the city.

It examines the way in which London borough councils have utilised the planning system in order to maximise affordable housing completions. It particular, it considers the way in which 'payments in lieu' (PiL) have contributed to the supply of affordable accommodation. This thesis assesses the planning policy framework for affordable housing provision in London. It also investigates past and current borough practices in respect of the implementation of these policies. This analysis includes an appraisal of the quantitative outputs of the planning system, including the particular contributions that have been forthcoming from PiL finances. The primary research for this thesis comprises a questionnaire survey of the thirty-three London boroughs and a number of case study planning applications involving PiL agreements. In addition, a range of secondary data sources are used in the analysis and evaluation, including Government 'Housing Investment Programme' (HIP) data. The findings of this thesis are considered in the light of the contemporary debate regarding the future of the system of planning obligations in the UK. The benefits and disadvantages of the current approach to seeking affordable housing provision through the planning system are evaluated within this wider context. This leads into an assessment of the various alternative policy approaches that could be adopted by the Government in relation to planning obligations, with particular reference to the issue of affordable housing contributions.", "Partners": "Local officers", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "Anonymous Public Engagement", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Anonymous Public Engagement ", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Discovery", "Output type": "Master thesis", "Title": "Payments in lieu -- A mechanism for maximising affordable housing provision in London?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a26c1acea8e7c73210b7ccb5ebee165e", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Pedestrian demand modelling ", "Project Location - In London": "Central London", "Date": "2003", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/233", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/233", "Authors": "Jake Desyllas\u00a0\nElspeth Duxbury\u00a0\nJohn Ward\u00a0\nAndrew Smith", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis\u00a0(51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "This paper introduces a methodology for the development of city wide pedestrian demand models and shows its application to London.

This is because different organisations, (both private companies andpublic bodies) hold environmental information relating to London and rarelyintegrate this information. In some instances free public access to thisinformation is not possible. In other situations, access is possible, but theinformation is often stored in a ?user unfriendly format?. This may beincomprehensible ?tabular? data, or data that is stored in a format that requiresthe user to purchase specialist software before attempting to view theinformation. Environmental Information Systems aim to integrate and improveaccess to this information and provide a variety of tools and technologies toassist the management and use of environmentally related data andinformation.This project aims to bring together some of this environmental data for Londonand provide access to it in an easier format. The main goal was to develop aprototype Environmental Information System for London. The system shoulddemonstrate how it is possible to combine information and provide a greaterinsight into London?s environmental situation. The system should alsocommunicate environmental information about London to a potentially ?wideranging audience? in an easy to use and intuitive manner.The outcome was London Environmental Information System or ?LondonEnvironment Online? (LEO) as it has been named. The naming includes theword ?Online? because it a new breed of Environmental Information Systemthat operates over the Internet or World Wide Web. This addresses severalissues since it allows a large number of people to access the system from avariety of locations. It also means that, although the core of the systemdepends upon expensive and powerful software packages, hardware anddatabases, the data within this can be used via a basic ?Internet Browser? or?Web Browser?. Web Browsers are typically free and commonly used on mostdesktop computers around the world to day.The report itself is directed to stakeholders involved in the monitoring andmanagement of the London environment. This ranges from senior politiciansand ministers responsible for implementing environmental policy to thosecollecting the basic data in the field and those responsible for storing anddisseminating this information. Particularly, the document is directed at centraland local government departments in their role as environmental decisionmakersand managers.

Given the lack of spatially disaggregated migration data that allows us to study patterns of dispersal from individual estates, in this article, we report on an attempt to use consumer-derived data (LCRs) to infer relocations at a high spatial resolution. The evidence presented suggests that around 85% of those displaced remain in London, with most remaining in borough, albeit there is evidence of an increasing number of moves out of London to the South-East and East of England.", "Partners": "1.

The proposed framework will leverage key concepts from uncertainty in spatial analysis, time geography, land use transport modelling, and urban planning. Under this theoretical framework, new variability measures will be developed and integrated as a function of space and time into operational urban models. These urban models will generate a more accurate evaluation of land use and transport impacts on people\u2019s mobility patterns in terms of the affected area and effect time.

Yet, the latter areas often have additional sustainability challenges including greater car dependence, struggling local retail centres, disintegrated housing developments and weaker active travel infrastructure. The ENHANCE project is designed to understand the barriers for the application of 15mC principles in outer metropolitan areas and small cities and provide evidence to improve local planning decision-making. This will be achieved through three main tasks:\n\n1.

Research has also shown the capacity of residents to self-organise, contest top-down schemes, and propose community-led alternative approaches (Sendra & Fitzpatrick, 2020). The aim of this research project is to co-produce with residents and communities a brief for the regeneration of the Trellick Tower and Cheltenham Estate, which includes how the process should be, how communities should participate in decision-making, how the process should reach the diversity of communities in the area, which are the spaces that people value, what needs to improve, and what kind of development they would want. For achieving these objectives, the project will use a Participatory Action Research approach, where the research outputs are co-produced with the communities affected.

Our case studies are three of Europe's leading urban centres: the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area; Greater London; and Grand Paris.\n\nThe proposal is timely as major cities have been faced with unprecedented development pressures. Their populations and economies have expanded and their envrionments have become highly attractive locations for global and national financial investment. These pressures have been particularly acute in the production and consumption of housing, where the impacts of investments on markets, citizens, and places are generating a widely perceived 'crisis' and set of new challenges for policy-makers and planners. There is a growing urgency to produce affordable housing for a variety of groups in order for cities to maintain their growth and to meet the needs of their citizens. A failure to tackle housing problems will both limit future growth potential and act as a source of social conflict and discontent.\n\nThe proposal draws on two streams of analysis. First we examine investment landscapes and the effectiveness of regulations and policy instruments that are designed to control them. We do this systematically and comparatively. Second we analyse the types of investment that are shaping housing markets and their impacts on people and places. We explore its sources, objectives, and designed outcomes.\n\nThe research meets an increasingly urgent need to develop better understandings of the complex relationships between markets, planning controls, and the quality of life of citizens in a context of escalating political tensions between different socio-economic groups and major global economic and social changes.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Planning and Policy", "Funder 1": "UK Research and Innovation ", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "ORA (Round 5) What is Governed in Cities: Residential Investment Landscapes and the Governance and Regulation of Housing Production"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "d8568420b32f70bf66bcee3129156825", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Adaptable Cities, Pandemic Mitigation and Crisis Preparedness", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2024", "Link": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/planning/research-projects/2024/jun/adaptable-cities-pandemic-mitigation-and-crisis-preparedness", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/planning/research-projects/2024/jun/adaptable-cities-pandemic-mitigation-and-crisis-preparedness", "Authors": "Lauren Andres\nPaul Moawad\nMarcus Zepf\nSakai Aya\nFederica Appendino", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Marcus Zepf, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil - Paris, (48.7881875, 2.4436875)\nSakai Aya, Tokyo City University, (35.5988125, 139.6506875)\nFederica Appendino, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Professions Immobili\u00e8res - Paris, (48.8340625, 2.3028125)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "This project aims to explore how cities have and can be adapted, proactively, within a very short timescale, as to immediately mitigate the impact of any future pandemics on people's health, well-being and local economies but also ensure their continuity as rich transactional spaces hosting all types of human, economic, financial and information flows.

However, the rise of internet-based platforms \u2014 digital marketplaces that match supply and demand \u2014 has fuelled the diversification and expansion of this practice in an unprecedented way. The market leader in the short-term accommodation sector is Airbnb, created in 2008 to allow landlords and tenants to advertise their homes for short-term rental. There now exists a variety of short-term rental platforms that differ in terms of their business models (peer-to-peer, business-to-consumer or both), their links with giants of the online travel industry, their geographical coverage and the types of accommodation they offer. Their offer has grown rapidly over the past decade, although interrupted in 2020 by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The likelihood is that as recovery from the pandemic comes about, the short-term rental market will rebound. This project analyses and compares how public actors in large European cities have attempted to regulate platform-mediated short-term rentals, and outlines which implementation and enforcement challenges they have faced in doing so.

The Stockholm region is growing rapidly and so, a significant housing shortage has become apparent. Housing prices and costs have been skyrocketing, with apartment prices having increased by 200% in a decade; and \u2018social renting\u2019 lists of up to two decades waiting time. The London metropolitan area has also seen a notable rise in population in recent years and this has increased prices to unprecedented levels and made it difficult for vulnerable households to access housing.\n\nBoth cities have earmarked densification of core urban areas and new housing development as solutions to this problem: in Stockholm, densification takes place within strategic nodes connected by transport corridors, forming a star shaped metropolitan structure delimited by ten green edges, while in London, a range of densification options have been deployed, from building tall to the purchase of social housing estates by private developers for new private denser residential development.\n\nUrban densification has been seen as an approach to counteract urban sprawl and deliver sustainable development via more compact cities which facilitate more efficient transportation and use of resources. This thinking has been combined with the orthodoxy of public space at human-scale or \u2018cities for people\u2019 to accommodate for the diversity of users and allow for positive social interactions in the urban environment. Both Stockholm and London have been using social sustainability and placemaking ideas to deliver denser as well as vibrant and socially viable urban environment and housing.\n\nAnecdotal evidence, however, points to the fact that in both cities the social sustainability agenda is used as a \u2018veiled declaration\u2019 for property-led development, which in turn is often connected to negative social impacts such as spatial displacement and segregation, gentrification and urban inequality. Moreover, placemaking is criticised for being aimed at \u2018place-promotion\u2019 and \u2018selling-the-city\u2019, and used by the two cities (and their developers) to increase property prices (and returns) at the cost of low income households. Hence, this project aims to answer two questions from a comparative perspective:\n\nQ1: What & where: What type of and where housing is delivered via densification in Stockholm and London?; and\n\nQ2: How & For Whom: What role do the social sustainability and placemaking agendas play in shaping housing outputs and meeting housing need in Stockholm and London?", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Urban densification and Housing Development: a critical investigation of the (social) sustainability, place (making) and property development agendas in Stockholm and London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "da19c0da0363aee6f74e671f1654057a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Almhouse Resilient Communities for the Future", "Project Location - In London": "United St Saviour's Charity (51.5021618, -0.0818345)", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/research/sustainability-built-environment/almshouse-resilient-communities-arc-future", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/research/sustainability-built-environment/almshouse-resilient-communities-arc-future", "Authors": "Niamh Murtagh\nEvelyn Callahan\nAlison Pooley\nJenny Pannell\nAlison Benzimra\nZoe Richardson\nLisa da Silva", "London Authors": "Alison Benzimra, United St Saviour\u2019s Charity, (51.5021618, -0.0818345)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Alison Pooley, University of Suffolk, (52.0524690, 1.1630934)\nZoe Richardson, Sir Josiah Mason Trust, (52.4427308, -1.8092278)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "Abstract": "The ARC for the Future project will examine how resilience can be fostered in almshouse communities, contributing to a wider research programme on suitable living environments for an older population.", "Partners": "United St Saviour\u2019s Charity\nSouthwark Charities\nHousing LIN", "Partnership Location - In London": "(51.5021618, -0.0818345)\n(51.4890942, -0.0812164)\n(51.5195166, -0.0999879)", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with charity", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "Collaborators", "Partnership 4": "Research Support ", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Sustainability ", "Funder 1": "Dunhill Medical Trust", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Almhouse Resilient Communities (ARC) for the Future"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "144681be12271df48e698b5d3fead183", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The London Research and Policy Partnership", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2024", "Link": "https://www.london.ac.uk/research/london-research-policy-partnership/lrapp-projects", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.london.ac.uk/research/london-research-policy-partnership/lrapp-projects", "Authors": "Ilias Krystallis", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "Abstract": "Our LPIP Phase 1 project will bring together academics, policymakers, businesses, and third sector groups, focusing on the economic, social, and environmental research opportunities of a just transition to net zero, with a particular focus on retrofitting London\u2019s homes.  \n \nDespite gathering pace over recent years, retrofitting at scale remains a challenge for London, but also presents an opportunity \u2013 for jobs, businesses, and communities.

The large amount of capital for infrastructure projects is tightly aligned with the fast and exponential global population growth, which, according to the United Nations, will reach 8 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Considering the high rate of budget overruns and delays in megaprojects, it is important to explore in depth the potential of innovative client models to deliver megaprojects. Considering the global infrastructure pipeline forecasted for the next decades, this research explores the formation of megaproject client organizations, which are new, dedicated, and often temporary entities created to deliver the project on behalf of the sponsor. The research is novel as it investigates three megaprojects in real time and adopts a supply chain management lens to conceptualize the formation and evolution of inter-organizational relationships. It contributes to two literatures, construction supply chain management and project delivery models, by exploring the megaproject client organization as the focal firm and its strategies to design the supply chain architecture. It builds upon previous research by exploring a different challenge to manage the supply chain in one-off settings, exploring the concurrent formation of a new entity and its supply chain strategies. Six megaprojects that at the time represented a combined investment of \u00a393.93 billion have been analyzed in the United Kingdom: High Speed 1 (\u00a36.16 billion), Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 (\u00a34.3 billion), London 2012 Olympics (\u00a38.77 billion), Crossrail (\u00a314.8 billion), Thames Tideway Tunnel (\u00a34.2 billion), and High Speed 2 (\u00a355.7 billion). The empirical data were collected through 210 semistructured interviews with senior megaproject leaders. Key research findings include: (i) the identification of the megaproject multilayer and multilevel organizational structure, identifying multiple organizational roles and responsibilities; (ii) understanding of the terminologies of owners, sponsors, clients, and operators in megaprojects, as well as the dynamics of its nonstatic and evolutionary nature throughout the project life cycle, unpacking who does what, when, how, and why; (iii) the process of the formation of temporary client organizations and the dimensions of the rationale behind the strategic decisions over time, in light of the plurality of potential integration methods between client and delivery partners; (iv) the importance of a clearly defined governance structure and recommendations to organize the inter-organizational relationships between sponsors, clients, delivery partners, and the supply chain. This research improves the understanding of the formation and evolution of megaproject client organizations, illustrating how the emerging temporary organizations design the supply chain architecture and the dynamics of the associated inter-organizational relationships. The research contributes toward a more informed, systemic strategic decision making by the client organization, impacting the inter-organizational relationships with the supply chain to improve megaproject delivery. Considering the sequential development of these projects, there is an opportunity to understand the evolution of the UK market as a client in delivering megaprojects, exploring the similarities and differences of the inter-organizational structures created over time. The aim is to provide guidance for megaproject promoters, policy makers, and practitioners in their strategic decisions in the front-end of those projects, increasing the knowledge of innovative structures to address the increasing global investment in megaprojects.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Construction and Engineering ", "Funder 1": "Project Management Institute", "Funder 2": "Major Projects Association", "Funder 3": "CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) ", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Reinventing megaproject delivery models: the rise of the capable owner"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a77ebec8e491746a771de8cf8276d9e8", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Twinning towards Research Excellence in Evidence-Based Planning and Urban Design", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2023", "Link": "https://twin2expand.surf.com.cy/about/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Karimi Kayvan \nSepehr Zhand\nGareth Simons \nEd Parham ", "London Authors": "Ed Parham ", "Other Author (National+International)": "Nadia Charalambous \nIlaria Geddes\nIason Giraud\nAndreas Papallas\nAna Ricchiardi \nMeta Berghauser Pont \nIoanna Stavroulaki \nAhmed Eldesoky \nMarco Trisciuoglio \nValentina Romano \nMichela Barosio ", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "TWIN2EXPAND is a research project that aims to enhance the excellence of research in the field of Evidence-Based Design and Planning (EBDP) at the University of Cyprus (UCY).\n\nThe project seeks to address urban challenges and opportunities in Cyprus, which is a unique context for EBDP research due to its climate and history.

The VDR will be co-created with local government, the local community, regulators and water utility companies ('end-users') to collaboratively plan and evaluate the environmental sustainability of urban growth planning scenarios using co-designed water neutrality indicators during the project. The VDR will use a whole-water system Digital Twin (FuturaWat) that supports evidence-led water neutral planning for place making. This will be achieved by integrating two state-of-art digital tools: GIS-based ground risk calculator (GRISC) and whole-water system model (CityWat) with a participatory process to facilitate end-user discussion and decision-making on housing and water system planning scenarios. The key novelty of the proposed research is in applying systems approaches to infrastructure planning, collaborative working and sustainability evaluation.\n\nThe VDR will be tested by applying it to Greater Manchester and London Borough of Enfield case study examples to enable end-users to align their strategic planning and water management priorities.

It often coincides with and contributes to other housing problems, such as damp and mould. It is a risk factor for many health outcomes including infections, injuries, and poor mental health. \nFor councils to alleviate the effects of overcrowding, new methods are required to identify which houses are overcrowded and how it affects residents. In particular, existing measures are not tailored to particular populations, such as families, where overcrowding limits children\u2019s ability to play and study.\n\nWhat are we seeking to do? In this feasibility study, we are seeking to develop a method to identify households with families at high risk of overcrowding affecting their wellbeing.\n\nObjectives:\nAgree on a definition of household overcrowding affecting family wellbeing with people that have lived experience of overcrowding\nOperationalize this measure in one council by combining publicly available and council-held data to identify households with families at risk of the health effects of overcrowding\nUnderstand the wider applicability of this measure with other councils and its implications for population-level intervention design\n\nMethods: A mixed methods design will be used. A resident engagement approach will be taken throughout the project. This considers families with lived experience of overcrowding and community representatives as partners in the project, alongside service professionals and researchers. From discussions with these groups, a description and definition of overcrowding affecting households with families will be produced. Based on this definition, data available to the council will be combined and analyzed quantitatively to provide a composite measure of household overcrowding affecting family wellbeing. The methods and illustrative results from one council will be shared with other councils, with a short survey to understand its wider applicability.\n\nAnticipated impact and dissemination: For councils, the project will provide a feasible method of identifying areas of potential overcrowding affecting the health of families in their area. Longer term, it will enable councils to design and target interventions to alleviate the effects of overcrowding and that may increase the wellbeing of families. Guidance will be produced and disseminated through council and public health networks. \nFor lived experience volunteers, the project should immediately provide the sense of feeling heard. Longer term, their views will have an influence on local and wider policy. Lay summaries in visual forms (e.g., video) will be developed with lived experience partners and disseminated via HealthWatch networks. \nFor research, this project will advance our understanding of methods to identify overcrowding affecting specific populations.

However, there is a lack of research on their value and use. Indicator producers, often from health fields, tend to have a linear and rational view of indicator use and policy-making that is starkly contrasted by urban policy scholars who see these processes as complex and socially constructed. It is therefore unclear how UHI tools might function within the complex planning policy and decision-making process to promote health considerations. This mixed-methods research investigates the use and value of UHI tools using collaborative rationality and systems theories. A two-part systematic review included a census of 145 UHI tools and a narrative synthesis of 10 qualitative studies on the use of UHI tools. The results were used to develop a taxonomy of UHI tools and theory of change. A series of 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with indicator producers and users in San Francisco, Melbourne and Sydney. These data were analysed using thematic analysis and systems thinking approaches to produce causal loop diagrams (CLD) of participants\u2019 mental models. The CLDs were tested and improved in a participatory modelling workshop. Indicator users and producers had significant overlap in their mental models. The development and application of UHI tools increased inter-sectoral relationships which supported actors to better understand each other\u2019s opportunities and constraints for health promotion. Relationships helped to create new advocates for health in diverse organisations, supporting health in all policies or whole-of-society approaches to health promotion. Community involvement in UHI tools and the effectiveness of advocates helped to challenge constraints to health-promoting policy development and implementation. However, the high number of new indicators being created can create confusion and reduce indicator use, particularly when they are not designed to meet users\u2019 needs.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Building Research Establishment Ltd", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "The Value and Use of Urban Health indicator tools in urban planning policy and decision making"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c04cc74139712b3c3b382f65bed53c6a", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "New Aviation, Propulsion, Knowledge and Innovation Network ", "Project Location - In London": "London City Airport (51.505278, 0.055278)\nHeathrow Airport (51.4775, -0.461389)", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research-projects/2023/sep/new-aviation-propulsion-knowledge-and-innovation-network", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research-projects/2023/sep/new-aviation-propulsion-knowledge-and-innovation-network", "Authors": "Schafer Andreas ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "Funded under the Phase 2 of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund\u2019s Future Flight Challenge, NAPKIN brings together a range of UK aviation expertise to investigate the potential of electric aircraft for UK regional flights.

Understanding the factors that contribute to high indoor temperatures in care homes is crucial in developing strategies to avoid summertime overheating and the associated negative health impacts, which are expected to intensify as a result of climate change. The pilot project is undertaking preliminary work in five care settings in London to monitor the summertime conditions experienced by residents and staff, model future overheating risks and investigate the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing the risk of overheating. It will then bring together the learning from monitoring and modelling in expert workshops to explore the implications for guidelines and regulations, and the potential for scaling-up the project to a national scale. The work will be of interest to relevant stakeholders from the built environment, social care, public health and policy development.\n\nAs a result of global climate change, the UK is expected to experience hotter and drier summers and heatwaves are expected to occur with greater frequency, intensity and duration. According to recent climate change projections by the Met Office, increases in mean daily temperatures could be up to 5.4 deg. C during the summer months and 4.2 deg. C during winter by 2070 under a high emissions scenario. In 2003, 2,091 heat-related deaths were reported in the UK alone as a result of the European heatwave, meaning future temperature increases could lead to a parallel rise in heat-related mortality. The UK also currently has a rapidly growing number of old people, with people aged 75 or over expected to account for 13% of the total population by 2035, compared with 8% in 2012. Older populations are more vulnerable to climate-induced effects as they are more likely to have underlying, chronic health complications, making them more vulnerable to heat stress. The 2003 heatwave demonstrated that older people in care settings are at the highest risk of heat-related mortality. People aged over 65 years spend more than 80% of their time in residential environments or care settings, and people aged over 85 years more than 90%. Therefore, the indoor environment is a huge moderator of heat exposure in older populations: poor building design and the lack of effective heat management in care settings may contribute to increased indoor heat exposure with detrimental health impacts falling on the most vulnerable residents. Care facilities function as both a home for residents and a workplace for staff, meaning that the people sharing those spaces can have diverging needs and preferences making overheating prevention measures difficult to enforce. Interactions between staff and residents play an important role in preventing overheating in care settings and it has previously been noted that staff are often made to prioritise warmth due to wide recognition of the detrimental effect cold weather can have on old-age health, leading to overheating risks being overlooked. Understanding factors that contribute to indoor summertime overheating in care homes is crucial in developing methods to prevent overheating and the subsequent negative health impacts.\n\nPrevious research by the applicants has indicated that care facilities are already overheating even under non-extreme summers, highlighting the need to develop timely prevention measures given the way temperatures are expected to rise in the UK over the next century. A key target for climate adaptation in care settings is to limit such risks by introducing passive cooling strategies via building design and occupant behaviour. Development of passive cooling strategies will reduce the likelihood of uptake of mechanical cooling, which would undermine government efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the principal aim of the project is to undertake preliminary work to develop methods that will support a system of care provision in the UK that is adequately prepared for rising heat stress under climate change. The project will undertake pilot work in five care settings in the UK to monitor the thermal environment and conduct surveys with residents, frontline care staff and care home managers. Within these buildings, it will test novel approaches for understanding the comfort levels of the residents and relating this to the thermal environment. It will also test novel measurement techniques for assessing impact of heat on the health of the residents. Via detailed modelling work, it will then test methods to assess future overheating risks and to evaluate the effectiveness of overheating mitigation strategies. Throughout the project the work will bring together multidisciplinary research perspectives with those of care home practitioners and other stakeholders. Via these packages of work, plans for the large-scale project that is so urgently needed in this area will be developed.", "Partners": "Emer O'Connell (Public Health England)\nAnnette Figueiredo (Greater London Authority)\nDavid James (Care Quality Commission)\nAndrew Mellor (PRP Architects LLP)\nAnastasia Mylona (Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers - CIBSE)", "Partnership Location - In London": "(51.5045224, -0.0221204)\n(51.5074947, 0.0162230)\n(51.5424985, -0.0113610)\n(51.5195166, -0.0999879)\n(51.4425798, -0.1543532)", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Co-authorship with academic partner(s)", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "Collaborators", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Climate Resilience of Care Settings"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "60dbe6ac8fadcfb1e6b9315ad284ae36", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Mitigation of mould growth in indoor heritage", "Project Location - In London": "Ham House (51.444167, -0.314167)", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/seaha-cdt/people/morena-ferreira", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/seaha-cdt/people/morena-ferreira", "Authors": "Morena Ferreira", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "Mould causes biodeterioration of historic materials and it is also a health hazard to those in contact with contaminated surfaces.

Specifically, this work is part of a broader project, which final aim is to support stakeholders through BIM. Given that humidity is one of the major causes of weathering, being able to detect, depict and forecast it, is a key task. A BIM model of a heritage building \u2013 enhanced with the integration of a weathering forecasting model \u2013 will be able to give detailed information on possible degradation patterns, and when they will happen. This information can be effectively used to plan both ordinary and extraordinary maintenance. The Jewel Tower in London, our case study, is digitised using combined laser scanning and photogrammetry, and a virtual model is produced. The point cloud derived from combined laser scanning & photogrammetry is traced out in with Autodesk Revit, where the main volumetry (gross walls and floors) is created with parametric objects. Surface characterisation of the fa\u00e7ade is given through renderings. Specifically, new rendering materials have been created for this purpose, based on rectified photos of the Tower. The model is then integrated with moisture data, organised in spreadsheets and linked to it via parametric objects representing the points where measurements had been previously taken. The spatial distribution of moisture is then depicted using Dynamo. This simple exercise demonstrates the potential Dynamo has for condition reporting, and future work will concentrate on the creation of a complex forecasting model to be linked through it.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "Consulatncy", "Partnership 2": "Co-authorship with other partner(s)", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Technology and Computation ", "Funder 1": "Historic England ", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Building Information Models from Monitoring and Simulation Data in Heritage Buildings"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "9bc7f5242e0045d5fdd77112df77a09d", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Human Health in a urbanized and warming world", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE/R01440X/1#/tabOverview", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE/R01440X/1#/tabOverview", "Authors": "Clare Heaviside", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "Both natural and man-made environments present serious hazards to human health. Exposure to risk factors such as air pollution, hot and cold weather and extreme events can cause reductions in general health and wellbeing, illness, hospitalization and even death. In the UK, an estimated 29,000 deaths are associated with particulate matter (PM) air pollution each year. In August 2003, a severe heatwave across Europe led to over 2,000 deaths in England, and 15,000 in France. It is estimated that this heatwave was responsible for up to 70,000 deaths over Europe as a whole.\n\nUrban populations are especially vulnerable to the risks from environmental hazards. For example, air pollution tends to be higher in cities, and the extra warming due to the urban heat island effect (which describes the increased temperature experienced in towns and cities compared with rural areas) leads to heat-related health impacts, including mortality. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) interacts with air pollution and can make it worse in cities, especially during heatwaves. Urban surfaces can even interact with weather systems and alter rainfall levels, leading to urban flooding from surface water runoff.\n\nRisks to health from environmental hazards in urban areas are increasing, due to the effects of climate change, increasing urbanization and ageing (more vulnerable) populations in most parts of the world. In 2010, more people across the world were classed as living in urban areas than rural areas for the first time. The UK is particularly urbanized; according to the 2011 census, 85% of people are classed as living in urban areas. The 2017 UK Government's Climate Change Risk Assessment highlights the need for more research into the health impacts of climate change, particulary for heat, and acknowledged the increased risks to health for urban populations. Climate change will exacerbate the effects of heat on health, through increases in mean temperature and more frequent and intense heatwaves. It is also likely to modify rainfall patterns, and alter concentrations of air pollutants such as ozone and PM, all of which will affect health.\n\nPolicies relating to climate change mitigation or adaptation require robust scientific evidence of the potential range of health impacts from multiple factors before implementation. Planned 'environmental change' in the form of interventions such as urban greening and building adaptation measures are designed to reduce future climate change as well as to adapt to the consequences of it. However, urban or building level interventions may also result in unintended negative health impacts such as increased air pollution, and these should be fully understood before measures are widely adopted.\n\nRelating environmental factors to population exposure requires a multi-disciplinary approach using a combination of epidemiological analysis, exposure assessment and chemistry or climate modelling. This process can be challenging, and a number of limitations may affect each stage of the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) process, including a lack of observational data, or insufficient representation of urban areas in modelling studies to assess temperature or air pollution exposure. The work proposed here will improve the representation of urban areas within regional meteorological and chemistry-climate models; investigate health impacts relating to the UHI and the impacts of the UHI on indoor temperature (where people spend the majority of their time) and the potential costs and benefits to health from a range of urban planning interventions.\n\nQuantifying existing health impacts in urban environments as well as the additional risks relating to climate change and planned environmental change will strengthen the evidence base for health impacts in the urban environment, help to inform public health, air pollution and urban planning policies, and will ultimately lead to an increase in the health of the population.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "Health", "Funder 1": "Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "Worktribe ", "Output type": "", "Title": "Human Health in an increasingly urbanized and warming world"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "84833d1f23fe0a1268eb217bb11c2675", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London Urban Sub-Terrain Energy Recovery", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2019", "Link": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research-projects/2021/sep/london-urban-sub-terrain-energy-recovery-luster", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research-projects/2021/sep/london-urban-sub-terrain-energy-recovery-luster", "Authors": "Hector Altamirano \nGraeme Maidment\nSteve Evans\nRob Liddiard", "London Authors": "Graeme Maidment, London South Bank University, 51.49814, -0.10154", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "Currently, the generation of heat is one of the biggest users of energy and emitters of greenhouse gases in our cities.\n\nA recent study for the Greater London Authority identified waste heat as a potentially substantial source of low grade heat, if it could be harnessed and re-purposed. Some of this waste heat is generated in the subterranean built environment of the city, which is extensive. Although the built environment below ground is quite widespread \u2013 think of the London Underground network of tunnels \u2013 the points at which heat can be extracted have the effect of condensing the heat into a limited number of outlets.\n\nThe LUSTER project \u2013 London Urban Sub-Terrain Energy Recovery \u2013 is using the 3DStock model developed by UCL Energy Insitute to map the locations of these subterranean waste heat extraction points. An analytical package is being designed to run on 3DStock, which will estimate heat demand in local buildings and then match this to the potential source(s) of waste heat. Linking the source heat point to demand is being achieved through the mapping of a \u2018virtual heat network\u2019, which can be optimised according to demand characteristics and route prioritisation, to allow cost effective use of energy that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThe LUSTER project is a collaboration with the lead partner London South Bank University (LSBU).

One approach to thinking about trend-breaking futures is to use visioning and backcasting as a form of scenario building. This paper presents the results of a recently completed project on backcasting for transport in London, where a 60% reduction target in CO2 emission levels (on 1990 levels) has been set for the transport to 2025. This challenging target is articulated through the baseline case and two images of the future, one pushing the technology harder and the other emphasising the role of behavioural change. Over 150 individual policy measures have been grouped together into mutually supporting policy packages that are in turn assembled into clusters of policy packages to see whether the targets set can be reached. A simulation model has been developed to test the multiple pathways to achieving the targets set, given a range of potentially different priority perspectives. The difficulty of reaching the targets set can be demonstrated, even if all of the policy packages are used to a \u2018high\u2019 level of application. When international aviation is included and the expected growth in travel over the next 20 years, the impossibility of target achievement is clearly demonstrated.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Low-carbon transport in a developed megalopolis: the case of London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "71c8f6fba136699f93b9b963b894bb96", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Simulating the Spatial Distribution of Employment in Large Cities", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2013", "Link": "https://ideas.repec.org/h/spr/adspcp/978-3-642-31779-8_5.html", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1007/978-3-642-31779-8_5", "Authors": "Batty M, Smith DA, Vargas-Ruiz C", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "In this chapter, we first review the development of employment location models as they have been developed for integrated models of land use transportation interaction (LUTI) where the focus is on the allocation of population and employment. We begin by sketching how employment models based on input\u2013output and multiplier relationships are used to predict future employment aggregates by type and then we illustrate how these aggregates are distributed to small zones of an urban region in ways that make them consistent with the distribution of population and service employment allocated using spatial interaction-allocation models. In essence, the structure we are developing, which is part of an integrated assessment of resilience to extreme events, links input\u2013output analysis to the allocation of employment and population using traditional land use transportation interaction models. The framework then down scales these activities which are allocated to small zones to the physical level of the city using GIS-related models functioning at an even finer spatial scale. The crucial link in this chain is how we distribute detailed employment types generated from the input\u2013output model to small zones consistent with the way population and services are allocated using the LUTI model. To achieve this, we introduce an explicit employment forecasting model in which employment types are related to functions of floorspace that they use. These are estimated using linear regression analysis which enables future predictions of their location to be scaled in proportion to the totals generated from the input\u2013output framework. These future estimates of floorspace condition the supply side of the model, and combined with accessibility indicators, provide the heart of the employment location model. We have developed this model for London and its region \u2013 south east England \u2013 and after presenting the results of the model, we sketch how the integrated framework is being used to generate scenarios for future employment and population change.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location -

These debates are associated with two parallel developments: First, the reassessment of space in the (global) economy and the \u2018rediscovery of the city\u2019 that took place from the 1980s onwards in several fields of academic enquiry (Amin and Graham, 1997). This work challenged earlier predictions (Toffler, 1980) that questioned the importance of space in economic, social, and work relationships in face of technological and economic transformations. Second, changes in cultural and local economic policy, which became increasingly intertwined and brought culture \u201cto the centre of policy- making as a potential economic resource\u201d (O\u2019Connor, 2010, 31). Policies initially focused on flagship cultural projects and city marketing and later developed into strategies aiming at fostering creative cities or clusters.

It discusses the structural limitations that privatisation and private financing have placed on state capacities, and the broader implications of change for the future governance and management of London.

This scoping study analyses carbon and health implications of increasing cooling demand, and identifies important physical attributes and occupants\u2019 behavioral patterns that affect air conditioning use, as well as, typical operational temperatures and schedules. The high satisfaction with domestic air conditioning units highlighted in both studies suggests that in the foreseeable future with changing climate the UK may experience a similar increase in market penetration of domestic air conditioning as has occurred in Greece over the last 20 years.

Thrift, a proponent of non-representational theory conceptualises space as an emergent property of practice that occurs prior to conscious definitions. Hence, space is a site of open-ended possibilities, a non-discursive affordance to life in a given locale. Conversely, place is a more conscious and meaningful construction that people use to understand the space they live in. Although it is a complex construction in its own right, \u2018a constellation of processes rather than a thing\u2019 (Massey 2005, 141), place is distinguished by including social narratives and meanings. The concept of place, therefore, extends beyond non-reflexive practices and material flows, incorporating instead purposeful social action in the form of political activities, values, norms, memories, stories and histories. This interplay between spatial materialities, socialities and culture, which transforms a generic space into a culturally charged place, is conventionally known as place-making. Place-making activities occur when we make efforts to define, understand, experience, navigate, utilise, modify or regulate what is happening in and with space. Therefore, place-making activities bridge between space and place. They draw on the mundane practices that serve to extend or maintain local social networks through face-to-face interaction, in addition to more purposive efforts to build a sense of place and belonging. Place-making then, is about the production of locality:  the set of processes that communities used to build a sense of place out of space (Appadurai 1996; Feld and Baso 1996). It involves turning a seemingly generic, ambiguous, unruly or \u2018fuzzy\u2019 site of spatial possibility into a more meaningful and social entity, where we recognise ourselves in relation to others.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Mediated spatial cultures: Place-making in London neighbourhoods with the aid of networked interactive urban screens"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "d1f0a210412054a69a9131bcec9d0d85", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Gottfried Semper and the Globalising of the London Building World", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://www.share.usi.ch/arc/semper_in_london.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.share.usi.ch/arc/semper_in_london.pdf", "Authors": "Fraser M", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Gottfried Semper and the Globalising of the London Building World in the 1850s"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "681c086b38af6e27d4246a0411b7770c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Urban 'regeneration' in historic places", "Project Location - In London": "King's Cross (51.5323954, -0.1230224)", "Date": "2019", "Link": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429462894-7/urban-regeneration-historic-places-evangelia-alverti-kalliopi-fouseki", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Alverti E, Fouseki K", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "Abstract": "This chapter explores the interface between urban design and heritage conservation in \u2018deep cities\u2019, defined as cities that comprise multiple and complex, interrelated temporal layers.

The project investigated five present-day temporary projects sited on vacant land in London. Conscious of the long history of creative temporary occupations, the project pushes against the ephemeral nature of interim projects of the past, strategically documenting the five case studies through interviews, film, site surveys and photographs.\nThe specific purpose of this paper is to contextualise this recent fieldwork against the wider historical background of the creative temporary uses of vacant urban space, therefore negotiating between definitions of \u2018vacant\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019. Vacant spaces have been historically associated with dereliction or abandonment, \u2018lost space\u2019 (Trancik 1986), \u2018urban voids\u2019 and \u2018cracks in the city\u2019 (Loukaitou-Sideris 1996). Against the perception of vacancy as waste and emptiness, a more positive reading has been promoted through the notion of the \u2018terrain vague\u2019 (de Sola-Morales 1995).\nAlthough the present-day case studies emerged out of a very particular political, economic and cultural context, that of the late-2000s recession, this is not the first time that temporary uses have emerged in the history of London. Some of the case studies of the research project are located on sites with legacies of use that stretch back far beyond the 20th century and such histories complicate our readings of these short-term projects. The paper is however primarily concerned with the post-war context of London, up to the present day. Using the case studies as a spur for reflection, it provides an overview of the key moments in the evolution of creative temporary projects developed in vacant spaces. The discussion\nalso highlights links between past and present projects. Setting out from the post-war reconstruction years, the paper explores the 1960s countercultural projects as well as the 1970s post-countercultural community garden movement and the urban ecology turn. It then considers the impact of an increasingly global environmental awareness in the 1980s, leading up to the 1990s regeneration boom. This broad survey is supported by specific historical examples of creative use - some of which have proved to be truly temporary whilst\nothers have managed to endure - explored through published material, interviews with initiators and archival photographic records.\nThrough this historical review the paper links London projects to wider movements worldwide, with particular references to US and Europe where a direct influence can be established.

Much of the critical literature on neoliberal urban development and many of the policy frameworks that shape planning systems characterise the real estate and investment sectors in a relatively simplified way. They are often presented, implicitly or explicitly, as a unified interest with a clear subjectivity built around: 'fast' returns from investment decisions; a lack of consideration for broader public interests; outlooks dominated by the conversion of places into profit maximising investment spaces; and counter-productive approaches towards citizens and government authorities who potentially seek to disrupt their programmes and projects. Such characterisations are becoming increasingly important as regulators in major cities such as London and Toronto are calling for the introduction of new policy technologies and techniques to try and exert greater territorial control over increasingly fluid investment flows, real estate actors and other institutions within cities. Through this chapter we will challenge these preconceived notions relating to real estate actor behaviour and demonstrate their more nuanced, integrated and essential role within London's politics of planning.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Capital flows in the capital: Contemporary Governmental Imaginations in London\u2019s urban development"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "2984f3ea0e93268804c0a8aa2ce450ab", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "LGBTQ+ Networks and Urban Governance in Global London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003002338-6/queer-infrastructures-ben-campkin", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003002338-6/queer-infrastructures-ben-campkin", "Authors": "Campkin B", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Urban Laboratory (51.52537536621094,-0.13254199922084808)", "Abstract": "Media interpretations in the mid-2010s simplistically attributed the decline of LGBTQ+ spaces in London to the rise of digital technologies, such as mobile dating apps. In this chapter, I first interrogate these arguments, using qualitative evidence, before turning to the case study of a still-unfolding major infrastructure-led redevelopment, Crossrail, around Tottenham Court Road Station in central London, to highlight the more profound ways that LGBTQ+ venues are networked into processes of urbanization. In this case, in 2006, we see the first attempt by City Hall to name a threat to a venue specifically because of its negative impact on a protected minority, defined under the category of \u2018sexual orientation\u2019. We also witness the first uses, in London, of online campaigns to express community objection to the potential loss of venues. A formal equalities impact assessment process highlighted the threat to one of the capital\u2019s biggest and most stridently commercial gay club nights, aligned as it was with international business and property interests. Smaller-scale venues in the vicinity, including those proactively inclusive of more marginalized LGBTQ+ people, were overlooked and closed. Often opportunistically located in precarious sites and buildings during temporary breaks in redevelopment cycles, LGBTQ+ venues of all models are vulnerable once those cycles accelerate. Under the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, following a crisis of closures in 2015, and after a period of extensive activism to protect and reopen queer spaces, licensed LGBTQ+ venues have now been categorized as \u2018social and cultural infrastructure\u2019 in policy discussions. I frame this designation by turning to earlier empirical studies of lesbian and gay populations\u2019 networks from the late 1960s, and to debates about relationality in queer theory of the 2000s. I propose that thinking of today\u2019s LGBTQ+ venues as queer infrastructure encapsulates the profile of dispersed, interconnected, heterogeneous LGBTQ+ communities in London, and the ways these attach to, traverse, and disrupt international lines of property, heritage, and identity in processes of social and cultural reproduction.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Queer Infrastructures: LGBTQ+ Networks and Urban Governance in Global London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "efe4c7c28fd6018f77025f5fa8be0172", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The governance of urban public spaces in London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/354/oa_edited_volume/chapter/2777467/pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.14324/111.9781787356795", "Authors": "De Magalhaes C", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "The governance of urban public spaces in London: In the public interest or in the interest of local stakeholders?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "52a1c52a4e2c58df9a9fb3f7e2094513", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Mapping Neo-Victorian Spaces of Horror", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2015", "Link": "https://brill.com/display/book/edcoll/9789004292338/B9789004292338-s010.xml", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://brill.com/display/book/edcoll/9789004292338/B9789004292338-s010.xml", "Authors": "Dobraszczyk P", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "This chapter explores the relationship between afterimages of Victorian underground\nLondon and horror cinema, focusing on Death Line (1972) and Creep (2004).

Evidence from past heatwave periods indicates that London\u2019s Urban Heat Island effect contributes substantially to heat-related mortality rates. During a warm period in 2006, the proportion of heat deaths attributable to this effect was estimated to be 37.7% in outer London, 46.6% in inner London and 47.2% in central London, compared to a reference rural location. The relative effect of the heat island needs to be also examined in conjunction with the influence of individual building geometry, fabric and system characteristics. Epidemiological analyses of London mortality records have demonstrated that the spatial variation of heat-related mortality in London reflects background mortality rates related to population age. As such, higher levels of excess heat-related mortality occur in areas towards the outskirts of London with larger proportions of older residents. Housing features, however, cause a larger variation in temperature exposure and associated risks than the heat island intensity alone. This chapter briefly discusses a series of London urban heat health assessment methods and decision-making support tools.KeywordsLondonUrban environmentCitiesHeatOverheatingUrban temperatureUrban warmingUrban climateUrban heat islandClimate changeThermal comfortHealthWellbeingHeat-related mortality", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Heat-Related Mortality in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "190659e691e8c623cff82ff1cd8019b5", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Transport CO2 mitigation and the production of low traffic neighbourhoods", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2022", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10159938/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10159938/", "Authors": "Hickman R, Afonin A", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "\u201cTransport CO2 Mitigation and the Production of Low Traffic Neighborhoods: Lessons from London,\u201d assesses the Low Traffic Neighborhood 21 (LTN21) in suburban West London and draws implications for wider contexts, such as in Asian cities, including that wide-ranging sustainable mobility strategies need to consider carbon dioxide and social equity impacts.

The chapter responds to calls for more evaluation and reflections on transdisciplinary research projects. We present a formative, developmental evaluation approach. Developmental evaluation is an iterative process supporting programme innovation, adaptation in changing and complex contexts. As an evaluation approach, it provides methodological flexibility to support adaptation - with a focus on nurturing learning as a core goal. In the case study of Thamesmead, a developmental evaluation approach was used to help frame concepts, track developments and share reflections.

Then, in 2002, the UK government introduced a new progressive beer duty tax which enabled small-scale brewers to brew beer while paying less tax than their larger competitors, thus levelling the uneven financial playing field that economies of scale had created. This chapter charts the impact of this transformative policy through the beer itself analysing data on over 9000 different beers brewed in the city by almost 300 different brewers. Through a detailed quantitative analysis of beers, their characteristics and their brewers, we document the evolving new beer scene unleashed by this small stroke of fiscal creativity. We find that once the small breweries were able to compete financially with the large breweries and a new cohort of passionate brewers had learned the necessary skills, a dynamic new beer landscape eventually emerged a decade or so after the fiscal change was made. This new scene reflects London\u2019s global status, showcasing the planetary influences shaping one of the most exciting contemporary beer landscapes in the world.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "From the Beer Orders to Last Orders - Legislation, Taxation and the Modern Beer Landscape of London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a186697728c27698fb72dd313d4a939d", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Making sense of and contesting the financialisation of public land and council housing", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/354/oa_edited_volume/chapter/2777480/pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.14324/111.9781787356795", "Authors": "Penny J", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Urban Laboratory (51.52537536621094,-0.13254199922084808)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Chapter", "Title": "Pragmatic fix or a farewell to welfare?

The paper deals with the notion of differentiation and choice that diversity implies, and the concepts of legibility and intelligibility, introduced by Lynch and Hillier respectively, to retrieve identities and structures from the physical environment that surrounds us. Through an analysis of correlation of spatial and occupational patterns, based on space syntax methodology, Clerkenwell is found to be a fragmented but structured system of different centers of activity developed around locally strategic streets. This paper argues that one part of its success lies in exactly the maintenance of a relatively complex and difficult to understand whole composed of relatively easy to understand parts. This may account for the longevity and diversity of local economy and urban fabric. Perhaps this can become a model for urban planners and decisions makers in seeking to reproduce the vibrancy of the 19th century European city.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Learning from London.

As a result, flooding is expected to occur more frequently in London. Flood simulation modelling has previously been done to predict the impact on the built environment for a variety of scenarios for London. However, such models have not taken into account the detailed hygric behaviour of the building stock under flooding and drying conditions which can vary significantly between property types, and can lead to prolonged damp and health problems. To address this problem, a building stock model of central London has been developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), with information on the age, structure, and height of each dwelling and assumptions about built form based on historical building standards and surveys. This paper describes a novel methodology for the development of a building stock model with the necessary information to carry out hygrothermal simulations of the penetration of water into the building envelopes of flooded homes and the subsequent drying under different environmental scenarios. It discusses how the risk of damp in flooded homes can be modelled using hygrothermal methods and supplemented with mould models. By combining the multidisciplinary components of GIS, building simulation, and microbiological modelling, a holistic picture of the potential health implications of flooding at a population level across different temporal and spatial scales can be developed.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "The simulation of the post-flood drying of dwellings in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "a22f8b4355fa9b7316c3378dc31d5e82", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "A GIS-based bottom-up space heating demand model", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2009", "Link": "https://www.aivc.org/resource/gis-based-bottom-space-heating-demand-model-london-domestic-stock", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.aivc.org/resource/gis-based-bottom-space-heating-demand-model-london-domestic-stock", "Authors": "Mavrogianni A, Davies M, Kolokotroni M, Hamilton IG", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "This paper demonstrates a systematic approach towards exploring the impact of urban built form and the heat island effect on the levels of domestic energy consumption in London.

We investigated the spatial variation in heat-related mortality risks across London due to population age, urban heat island (UHI) and building characteristics. Methods Dynamic building physics models were run for 126 different age and built form variants of buildings statistically representative of the London housing stock, outputting average maximum daily internal temperatures for a hot summer period in 2006. Internal and modelled UHI temperature estimates for the same period in London were mapped to individual dwellings in Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and deviations of building-specific indoor and outdoor temperatures from the London-average were calculated and summarised at ward level. Office of National Statistics age-specific absolute mortality data and the above-calculated UHI and indoor temperature anomalies were then used to estimate spatial variation in mortality according to an age-specific relative risk function for heat in London. Results There was appreciable variation in indoor temperatures under the modelled climate, with a mean maximum range of 2.5\u00b0C. Modelled results indicate that the largest mortality risks may lie in outer London, as the elderly population is larger there than in Central London. Top-floor flats in multiple occupancy buildings and bungalows were found to be the most at-risk dwelling types. Limitations in building stock information and occupancy scenario assumptions mean that some buildings may be worse than modelled. Conclusions These results indicate that UHI and indoor temperatures may cause an appreciable spatial variation in the risks from heat-related mortality, but that the driving factor remains population age. Further work is required to explore the risks for individuals living in extreme heat-poor housing conditions or for those unable to take action to cool the indoor environment.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Mapping estimated heat-related mortality in London due to population age, urban heat island, and dwelling characteristics"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "7e3f6ca49ac2496d99b89811b967d941", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Sustainable Urban Development of London to 2100", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2010", "Link": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250928783_INTEGRATING_A_GIS_BASED_LAND-USE_TRANSPORT_MODEL_AND_CLIMATE_CHANGE_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT_ANALYSIS_FOR_SUSTAINABLE_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_OF_LONDON_TO_2100", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250928783_INTEGRATING_A_GIS_BASED_LAND-USE_TRANSPORT_MODEL_AND_CLIMATE_CHANGE_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT_ANALYSIS_FOR_SUSTAINABLE_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT_OF_LONDON_TO_2100", "Authors": "Ford A, Barr S, Dawson R, Batty M, Hall J", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Ford A, Barr S, Dawson R, Hall J, Newcastle University, 54.978, -1.615", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Integrating a GIS Based Land-Use Transport Model and Climate Change Impact Assessment Analysis for Sustainable Urban Development of London to 2100"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "05effda7751ed8c0c53d02efd3363afe", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "London's Housing Crisis", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1570446/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1570446/", "Authors": "Dianati K, Zimmermann NZ, Davies MD", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "One does not need to be an expert in housing to be concerned about the severity of the current\n housing crisis in London.

This exploration is often constrained by the availability of large-scale data at fine spatio-temporal resolution. Longitudinal data, such as the Foursquare data, allow researchers to explore different aspects of the functional structure of cities, such as the role of places and the human mobility that occurs between them. However, never mind their size, this type of data is often incomplete, capturing only parts of the functional city due to the biases in the data collection that might represent a part of the population only. In this paper we explore how Foursquare data can help unveil aspects of the functional structure of London.

It includes threedimensional information about buildings including their heights, volumes, wall areas, floor areas and the\n distribution of activities between different floors. These data are drawn from University College London Energy\n Institute\u2019s existing 3DStock model of London. Within the model information is attached on the ages of\n buildings, their materials of construction, and (in some cases) their servicing systems. Energy Performance\n Certificates (EPCs) and Display Energy Certificates (DECs) are also attached to premises and dwellings along\n with gas and electricity energy consumption.\n Buildings in London are responsible for over 65% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributed\n to the Greater London region in 2016. Reducing CO2 emissions that can be attributed to buildings is the key\n focus of this work in line with the GLA\u2019s ambition to dramatically reduce these overall CO2 emissions; aiming to\n make London a zero-carbon city by 2050.\n Improving the energy performance of existing buildings has to be a key strategy if the overall CO2\n emissions are to be reduced. Knowing the characteristics and current energy efficiency of the building stock is\n the first step towards reducing direct and indirect CO2 emissions from these buildings. Collecting the data is\n one challenge, but making sense of these huge quantities of data is a bigger challenge. Structuring the data can\n help here and so for this paper we present the evaluation of energy efficiency of buildings in London using\n urban density to aggregate the data. Energy efficiency is measured from both EPCs and energy consumption.\n Some of the existing measures that might influence current energy efficiency are then shown at different levels\n of urban density. Finally, in order to address the improvement of the energy efficiency we quantify the\n \u2018potential\u2019 improvements of these buildings (according to the EPC recommendations) and hence the suitability\n of different retrofit solutions, again aggregated by urban density. The results show that energy use intensity\n decreases as urban density increases; that urban density has some influence on existing efficiency measures\n and finally that most of the measures of retrofit potential change with increasing urban density.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Urban density and energy efficiency in the London Building Stock Model"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "429097d6d4512081972200280b703dc4", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "A typology of megaproject client models", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10121105/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10121105/", "Authors": "Denicol J, Davies A", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction (51.521897,-0.134542)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "A typology of megaproject client models: Insights from six megaprojects in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "b59bb628f708e6056a99f284e6aba19d", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "World's top acousticians converge on capital for ICSV24", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://www.ioa.org.uk/sites/default/files/Acoustics%20Bulletin%20November-December%202017_0.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://www.ioa.org.uk/sites/default/files/Acoustics%20Bulletin%20November-December%202017_0.pdf", "Authors": "Kang J", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources (51.526804,-0.129844)", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "London calling: World's top acousticians converge on capital for ICSV24"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "8c3ec1b1fc0760c2b32bf5870f2e96de", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Current and Future Risk of Overheating in London\u2019s Care Homes", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2021", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10137961/1/Tsoulou_BS2021_FINAL.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.26868/25222708.2021.30677", "Authors": "Tsoulou I, Jain N, Oikonomou E, Petrou G, Howard A, Gupta R, Mavrogianni A, Milojevic A, Wilkinson P, Davies M", "London Authors": "Ai Milojevic, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 51.5209, -0.1307", "Other Author (National+International)": "Alastair Howard, Oxford Brookes University, (51.7550625, -1.2241875)", "Department": "UCL Energy Institute\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)", "Abstract": "The warming climate causes adverse effects on thermal\ncomfort and health, especially for vulnerable older\nadults.

Reducing energy demand by implementing rapid energy saving measures has been effective in mitigating many electricity shortages globally to date. This thesis investigates whether similar measures could be effective in the UK in the event of a natural gas shortage, using a case study of London\u2019s households. A mail survey was developed and sent to a sample of 1,600 households in London to investigate which energy saving actions respondents would implement in a gas shortage. The questionnaire suggested a hypothetical scenario, where the media and government asked households to save energy for one month and also included questions about the respondents, their households and their dwellings. The resulting energy savings were subsequently calculated for each household using \u2018MESAH\u2019, a computer model developed during this research. This model used energy saving estimates based on a review of literature about household activities that use energy. Using these assumptions, the savings achieved by the different households varied vastly, reaching an overall total of approximately 30% of normal gas and electricity use in January. This result was relatively stable during the winter season. It was however found to be very sensitive to assumptions taken about the energy savings, and whether the respondents implemented actions as stated in the survey. It also found that the different actions proposed had very disparate saving impacts. The savings calculated represent high estimates of energy saving potential, rather than predictions due to uncertainties and limitations in the research. The project identified rapid energy savings as an option for an emergency response, but stressed that this approach should only be taken in extreme situations", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Rapid energy savings in London's households to mitigate an energy crisis"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "0917cb3dd603141faeee7b84a728f346", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Widening Price Gap for Sustainable Housing", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2023", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10178025/", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10178025/", "Authors": "Smith DA", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "London\u2019s sustainable planning aims are being affected by acute housing affordability challenges.

Moreover, the nominal reduction in some types of crime may be associated with the fact that the crime is harder for the police to spot in the dark, for example, drug offences.</jats:p>", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "The impact of light and dark on crime in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "4950764f96de0cefd5e7a28ea8d751b5", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.5281/zenodo.10897767", "Authors": "Ma D, Brousse O, Hudson-Smith A, De Jode M", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Using Bespoke LoRaWAN Heat Sensors to Explore Microclimate Effects within the London Urban Heat Islands\u2013 A Pilot Study in East London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "1d3aabf7945b8b417b62e96be9817960", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Varoudis T, Hanna S", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference paper (text)", "Title": "Beyond Axial Lines: High-Resolution Geometric Analysis of London\u2019s Urban Fabric Using LIDAR Scans"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "0cbc4a7b33dc76fa34152003c8d0f39c", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Sacred Cow or Sacrificial Lamb?

Overheating in such cities is expected to be exacerbated in the future as a result of further urban growth and climate change. Demonstrating and quantifying the impact of individual design interventions on the UHI is currently difficult using available software tools. The tools developed in the LUCID ('The Development of a Local Urban Climate Model and its Application to the Intelligent Design of Cities') research project will enable the related impacts to be better understood, quantified and addressed. This article summarises the relevant literature and reports on the ongoing work of the project.Practical applications: There is a complex relationship between built form, urban processes, local temperature, comfort, energy use and health. The UHI effect is significant and there is a growing recognition of this issue. Developers and planners are seeking advice on design decisions at a variety of scales based on scientifically robust, quantitative methods. The LUCID project has thus developed a series of tools that (1) quantify the effect of urbanisation processes on local environmental conditions, and (2) quantify the impact of such conditions on comfort, energy use and health. The use of such tools is vital, both to inform policy but also to be able to demonstrate compliance with it.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "The comfort, energy and health implications of London's urban heat island"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c0c87bfa7b9183511a2d0adcbe3d17f9", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "An exploration of the 3-D GIS experience involved in the creation of Virtual London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2006", "Link": "https://doi.org/10.4000/cybergeo.2871", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.4000/cybergeo.2871", "Authors": "Stephen\u00a0Evans\nAndrew\u00a0Hudson-Smith\nMichael\u00a0Batty", "London Authors": "Chalabi Z\nWilkinson P\nThe London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK (51.520990856931604, -0.13033375948157494)\n\nArup, London, UK (51.521873678400716, -0.13788468407282606)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "In this paper, we outline how we have developed a series of technologies to enable detailed interactive 3-D Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based models of cities to be created. Until relatively recently these models have been developed in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software more often then in GIS. One of the main reasons was that \u20183-D GIS\u2019 was often only 2.5-D under closer inspection. This is changing, and by straddling both technologies, and integrating others, we show how these models in turn enable planning information, statistics, pollution levels, sea level rises and much more to be visualised and analysed in the context of the 3-D city model. The client for \u2018Virtual London\u2019 is the Greater London Authority (GLA) and their aim is to develop improved dissemination of planning information, which is explored. We then argue that virtual cities should go well beyond the traditional conceptions of 3-D GIS and CAD into virtual worlds and online design. But we also urge caution in pushing the digital message too far, showing how more conventional tangible media is always necessary in rooting such models in more realistic and familiar representations.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "3-D GIS: Virtual London and beyond - An exploration of the 3-D GIS experience involved in the creation of Virtual London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "e11ead7d5a20e5efc45dc02e0fdc5333", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Simulations of the London Urban Heat Island", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2011", "Link": "https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000295139700018&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=f41074198c063036414efcbc916f8956", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1002/qj.855", "Authors": "SI Bohnenstengel \nS Evans\nPA Clark \nSE Belcher", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "SI Bohnenstengel\nPA Clark\nSE Belcher\nDepartment of Meteorology, University of Reading, Reading, UK (51.439140646793696, -0.9367815211279447)", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "We present simulations of London's meteorology using the Met Office Unified Model with a new, sophisticated surface energy-balance scheme to represent the urban surfaces, called MORUSES. Simulations are performed with the urban surfaces represented and with the urban surfaces replaced with grass in order to calculate the urban increment on the local meteorology. The local urban effects were moderated to some extent by the passage of an onshore flow that propagated up the Thames estuary and across the city, cooling London slightly in the afternoon. Validations of screen-level temperature show encouraging agreement to within 1\u20132 K, when the urban increment is up to 5 K. The model results are then used to examine factors shaping the spatial and temporal structure of London's atmospheric boundary layer. The simulations reconcile the differences in the temporal evolution of the urban heat island (UHI) shown in various studies and demonstrate that the variation of UHI with time depends strongly on the urban fetch. The UHI at a location downwind of the city centre shows a decrease in UHI during the night, while the UHI at the city centre stays constant. Finally, the UHI at a location upwind of the city centre increases continuously. The magnitude of the UHI by the time of the evening transition increases with urban fetch. The urban increments are largest at night, when the boundary layer is shallow. The boundary layer experiences continued warming after sunset, as the heat from the urban fabric is released, and a weakly convective boundary layer develops across the city.

Governing a world city like London has always been a difficult process. Legislative commitments to address London's sustainable future have sometimes been undermined by different policy interpretations by different key players over different time periods. This has created a fluid and diverse structure of governance that enables short-term policy shifts but which threatens longer term strategic sustainability policy commitments. These interpretations have occurred against an ongoing and contentious political debate over powers and responsibilities between different scales of the state, and the rights to make key decisions affecting London's future. This has resulted in a policy and governmental structure that is highly dependent on negotiation and compromise and one that employs a variety of policy tools, information and persuasion, financial incentives, and collaboration, to achieve a balanced form of governance. This flexible arrangement enables divergent public attitudes towards sustainability and climate change to be harnessed but may not deliver long term urban sustainability.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Governing London and Sustainability: Power and Contestation in a World City"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "45ca877160f8365566a1b4602fc96ecb", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Transitions to low carbon transport futures", "Project Location - In London": "London\nDelhi", "Date": "2011", "Link": "https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S096669231100130X", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.03.013", "Authors": "Robin Hickman\nOlu Ashiru\nDavid Banister", "London Authors": "Olu Ashiru\nExhibition Rd, South Kensington, London SW7 2AZ (51.49895567931085, -0.17485205410157478)", "Other Author (National+International)": "David Banister\nWellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD (51.757195617293064, -1.2545179018013086)", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Climate change is a global problem and across the world there are major difficulties being experienced in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies.\n\nDifferent packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions.\n\nThe scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a \u2018strategic conversation\u2019 at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives.

Projected higher temperatures due to a change in climate would further exacerbate the effects of London's UHI. It is therefore necessary to understand its net impact and adopt strategies to cope with and mitigate its negative aspects. The Lucid project is addressing both these issues and this paper focuses on the second component. There is currently a lack of practical assessment instruments available to planners, designers and developers that can assess a development's impact on the UHI. This paper thus presents a proposal for a multi-scaled UHI assessment tool framework that could be used in developing relevant planning policy and assessing UHI mitigation design strategies. The paper discusses how a framework of this type could be integrated into the development planning process in London and the UK.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "London\u2019s Urban Heat Island: A multi-scaled assessment framework"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "e1a2d4215347633d56513b6a36fdd9d5", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Gates of London and Temple Bar in the seventeenth century", "Project Location - In London": "Aldgate (51.51356943237763, -0.07730524598890315)\nBishopsgate (51.51694455216066, -0.08110141715306356)\nMoorgate (51.51726525652797, -0.08881764598872771)\nCripplegate\nAldersgate\nNewgate\nLudgate\nTemple Bar", "Date": "2006", "Link": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/40033818", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1017/S0066622X00002719", "Authors": "Emily Mann", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "In the seventeenth century London was a walled city, as it had been since the Romans fortified it around 200 AD. The gates erected by the Romans on the most important routes in and out of the city were rebuilt on their ancient foundations in the medieval period, when posterns (smaller passageways) were added in the wall and a huge ditch was dug around the outside. By the seventeenth century, there were seven principal gates in the old wall: from east to west starting from the Tower, they were Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Moorgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate and Ludgate. On the bridge across the River Thames \u2013 the only point of entry to the City from the south \u2013 there were two more gates. The ditch, as John Stow recorded in his Survey of London (first published in 1598), was \u2018of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and houses builded thereon\u2019. This treatment of the ditch points to how the urban fabric had long since pushed through the gates and beyond the old walls; this area \u2018without\u2019, but still under the City\u2019s jurisdiction, was known as the Liberties. In Hollar\u2019s map of London in the later seventeenth century (Fig. 1), the walls and gates are a clearly visible feature defining the core of the City, which none the less spreads beyond them, in particular to the west. The limits of the Liberties were marked on main roads by \u2018bars\u2019, usually consisting of posts and chains, as at Holborn (to the north) or Whitechapel (to the east). Temple Bar, however, situated on Fleet Street to the west of Ludgate, had been made a gateway by the mid-fourteenth century, a reflection of its importance as the main point of transition between the Cities of London and Westminster. As such Temple Bar was considered one of the City gates; it was the eighth gate in the engraved plate that accompanied John Strype\u2019s version of Stow\u2019s Survey, published in 1720.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "In defence of the city: The Gates of London and Temple Bar in the seventeenth century"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "366c49ac8d7f821bc65d62b4d1acfff0", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/doi/pdf/10.1080/13604813.2012.696903?needAccess=true", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/02697459.2012.694306", "Authors": "Mike Raco", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "No abstract", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "The privatisation of urban development and the London Olympics 2012"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "ea61bcbcaee944046daf05aa24345130", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The Politics of London\u2019s Strategic Design", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2012", "Link": "https://web-p-ebscohost-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=4bb0ed90-f099-46cd-9dee-4aa55093ec56%40redis", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Matthew Carmona", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Matthew Carmona tracks the vicissitudes of London\u2019s political engagement in urban design over the last decade.

The annual primary energy demand was 125kWh/m2, marginally above the 120 kWh/m2 target. The measured internal heat gains of 3.65 W/m2 are much greater than the 2.1 W/m2 suggested as standard for dwellings. The Passive House Planning Package, PHPP, is found to be a good predictor of space heating demand and the risk of summer time over heating. Winter space heating demand is sensitive to occupant blind use.

The dual representation of a planar graph is a content-based network, where each node is a set of edges of the planar graph and represents a transportation unit in the so-called information space, i.e., the space where information is handled in order to navigate through the city. First, we discuss a novel hybrid technique to extract dual graphs from planar graphs, called the hierarchical intersection continuity negotiation principle. Then we show that the growth of the network can be analytically described by logistic laws and that the topological properties of the network are governed by robust log-normal distributions characterizing the network's connectivity and small-world properties that are consistent over time. Moreover, we find that the double-Pareto-like distributions for the connectivity emerge for major roads and can be modeled via a stochastic content-based network model using simple space-filling principles.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Exploring the evolution of London's street network in the information space: A dual approach"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "44ddda54a138fa0b1514c3d155802003", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Mapping the 'Space of Flows'", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2014", "Link": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00343404.2013.856515", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/00343404.2013.856515", "Authors": "Jonathan Reades\nDuncan A.

Driven by the European Union's 20-20- 20 strategy, Governments throughout Europe have implemented policies to support renewable generation and energy efficiency. In the UK, a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme was launched in 2010 and has been so successful in creating growth in the PV market that tariff digression has had to be accelerated. A loan scheme, the Green Deal, which provides up front capital for energy efficiency measures was launched in 2012.\n\nDespite the success of the FiT scheme, the penetration of PV in London has lagged behind other areas. In this paper we examine the reasons for this by taking Berlin and the German policy of Feed-in Tariffs and soft-loans as a comparator and modeling the effect of tariff rates and loan availability on uptake in London to understand the impact the Green Deal might have on the UK PV market. Further, we address another important consideration for policy, namely, shortcomings in the field performance of PV systems through the comparison of theoretical and measured performance. It is concluded that soft-loans would have a limited impact on market growth when compared with the effect of providing increased FiT rates to social landlords.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "PV System Performance and the Potential Impact of the Green Deal Policy on Market Growth in London, UK"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "9afa4f94c6253511dc86f193978b39bc", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Indoor air quality in London schools: Part 1", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2014", "Link": "https://journals-sagepub-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1177/1420326X14527976", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/17508975.2014.918871", "Authors": "Lia Chatzidiakou\nDejan Mumovic\nAlex James Summerfield\nMartin T\u00e0ubel\nAnne Hyv\u00e4rinen", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "Martin T\u00e0ubel\nAnne Hyv\u00e4rinen\nDepartment of Environmental Health, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Kuopio, Finland\n(62.89666626096984, 27.641130827318015)", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute /\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "This study aims to assess the adequacy of current guidelines, framed around thermal comfort, estimated ventilation rates, and CO2 levels, for the provision of indoor air quality (IAQ) in school classrooms. It draws on detailed monitoring data from a sample of 18 classrooms from 6 London schools. Overheating during the non-heating season was identified in eight south-, south-east-, and east-facing classrooms in two Victorian and two contemporary schools. Four classrooms in these contemporary schools also failed to keep average indoor CO2 levels below 1500\u2005ppm in the non-heating season. During the heating season, eight classrooms exceeded the daily average indoor CO2 levels. Mean indoor particulate matter (PM)10 and PM2.5 levels recorded in all classrooms in both seasons were higher than 20 and 10\u2005\u03bcg/m3, respectively, indicating that school exposure during an academic year may exceed annual recommended WHO [Citation2006. Air Quality Guidelines: Global Update 2005: Particulate Matter, Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Sulfur Dioxide. Copenhagen: WHO Regional Office for Europe; Citation2010. WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air Quality: Selected Pollutants. Copenhagen: WHO Regional Office for Europe.] guideline values in all classrooms. In both seasons, all classrooms were found to have indoor total volatile organic compounds levels (median: 269\u2005ppb and interquartile range: 64\u2013408\u2005ppb) above guideline thresholds (130\u2005ppb) associated with sensory irritations.

The results of the microclimatic modelling were then used as input into a whole building thermal simulation model, in order to assess the direct and indirect effects of the roofs. The building modelling results indicate that in the current climate, green roofs reduce annual energy use within the building. The level of savings are reduced when green roofs are dry in the summer. Cool roofs are more effective in the summer, but result in an annual energy penalty due to their performance in winter. In a 2050 climate scenario, both green and cool roofs result in a reduction in annual energy use. The application of traditional insulation is the most effective technology at reducing annual energy use. Adding insulation and a green or cool roof reduces the relative effectiveness of the roofs.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Microclimatic effects of green and cool roofs in London and their impacts on energy use for a typical office building"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "adb7bfae82171287961c644834bf1b8b", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Using the new CIBSE design summer years to assess overheating in London", "Project Location - In London": "London Weather Centre (51.53079698440101, -0.12077196142247441), Heathrow (51.46815846005924, -0.4551153749184412) and Gatwick (51.15377647279892, -0.1821165460929191)", "Date": "2015", "Link": "https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000349980700003&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=f41074198c063036414efcbc916f8956", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1177/0143624414566247", "Authors": "Gurdane Virk\nAnastasia Mylona\nAnna Mavrogianni\nMichael Davies", "London Authors": "Anastasia Mylona\nThe Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers, UK\n51.44222698031067, -0.1543996154012606", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "[UCL Energy Institute /\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage (ISH)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering (IEDE)\u00a0/\u00a0UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources (ISR)]", "Abstract": "The new CIBSE design summer years (DSYs) for London Weather Centre, Heathrow and Gatwick in London are now available for three baseline years: 1976, 1989 and 2003.

It assesses the impacts and outcomes of so-called new localist reforms and argues that we are witnessing two principal trends. First, governance processes are increasingly dominated by anti-democratic development machines, characterized by new assemblages of public- and private-sector experts. These machines reflect and reproduce a type of development politics in which there is a greater emphasis on a pragmatic realism and a politics of delivery. Second, the presence of these machines is having a significant impact on the politics of planning. Democratic engagement is not seen as the basis for new forms of localism and community control. Instead, it is presented as a potentially disruptive force that needs to be managed by a new breed of skilled private-sector consultant.

It is offered with a view to help better identify the distribution of the projects costs and benefits and shed greater light on the possible \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019 over space and time, and under given scenarios.\nDrawing from an extensive array of public domain literature the paper sets out both the policy and planning contexts for the project plus the business case that led to a decision by UK Treasury to guar- antee a \u00a31 billion loan to Transport for London for the construction of the Northern Line's extension. The paper looks at the scale and nature of the megaproject's features, particularly its line-haul and related real estate developments, especially those in the assigned development opportunity area. The text presents the policy, planning, legislative and regulative dimensions of the project likely to define its revenue generation prospects and environmental and social impacts, with special attention paid to those project outcomes affecting key stakeholders over time and space. The paper also seeks to explain the mechanics of how to employ a policy-led multi-criteria framework together with its associated processes within which stakeholder policies and agendas can be mapped and common/divergent interests iden- tified. This is done with a view to ultimately facilitate stakeholder negotiation decision-making trade-offs in given scenarios under the policy guidance of the Greater London Authority with the support of the Treasury of the UK Government.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Application of Policy-Led Multi-Criteria Analysis to the Appraisal of the Northern Line Extension in London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c5cf59351b71e533a3dd0ccf8890d609", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "How the London Playboy Club bankrolled Hugh Hefner's empire", "Project Location - In London": "45 Park Lane (51.50655024151481, -0.1516414594820889)", "Date": "2015", "Link": "https://www.architectural-review.com/today/how-the-london-playboy-club-bankrolled-hefs-empire", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Barbara Penner", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Playboy, that great icon of American pop culture, owed its existence for many years to gambling revenue from Blighty.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Bunny Business: How the London Playboy Club bankrolled Hugh Hefner's empire"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "7c907706cb75312896d3744ca62a7555", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Finding Pearl's in London's Oysters", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2016", "Link": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/44132285", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.2148/benv.42.3.365", "Authors": "JON READES\nCHEN ZHONG\nED MANLEY\nRICHARD MILTON\nMICHAEL BATTY", "London Authors": "JON READES\nCHEN ZHONG\nDepartment of Geography, Kings College London, King's College London, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, UK (51.51319247954432, -0.11706494598889695)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "Public transport is perhaps the most significant component of the contemporary smart city currently being automated using sensor technologies that generate data about human behaviour. This is largely due to the fact that the travel associated with such transport is highly ordered. Travellers move collectively in closed vehicles between fixed stops and their entry into and from the system is unambiguous and easy to automate using smart cards. Flows can thus be easily calculated at specific station locations and bus stops and within fine temporal intervals. Here we outline work we have been doing using a remarkable big data set for public transport in Greater London generated from the smart card data called the Oyster Card which has been in use for over 13 years. We explore the generic properties of the Tube and Overground rail system focussing first on the scale and distribution of the flow volumes at stations, then engaging in an analysis of temporal flows that can be decomposed into various patterns using principal components analysis (PCA which smooth out normal fluctuations and leave a residual in which significant deviations can be tracked and explained. We then explore the heterogeneity in the data set with respect to how travel behaviour varies over different time intervals and suggest how we can use these ideas to detect and manage disruptions on the system.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Finding Pearls in London's Oysters"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "5f7ddd24f07518e1f73eb45e9d2eeded", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The politics of \u201cCooperative Governance\u201d at a time of \u201cAusterity Localism\u201d in London", "Project Location - In London": "Lambeth (51.45796378171807, -0.12043431420182626)", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02723638.2016.1235932?needAccess=true", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/02723638.2016.1235932", "Authors": "Joe Penny", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "At a time of \u201causterity localism\u201d, this paper explores how local authorities in London, England, are simultaneously addressing the dual pressures of delivering fiscal retrenchment and of enrolling citizens in new participatory public service arrangements, asking whether \u201cthese trends pull against one another, in opposite direc- tions, or whether they are the tough and tender dimensions of a singular process: austerian management\u201d Drawing on empirical research into the London Borough of Lambeth\u2019s Cooperative Council agenda, as well as Foucauldian and Gramscian critiques of participatory network governance theories and practice, this paper shows how participatory forms of governance can be folded into the logic of hierarchy and coercion through various govern- mental technologies of performance and agency (consent), and through tactics of administrative domination (coercion).

It concludes, first, that industrializing areas of the north emerged as a competitor for potential migrants\u2014contributing relatively fewer migrants than predicted by the model. Rising wage rates in these areas appear to explain this phenomenon. Second, it argues that migration from urban centres in the west midlands and parts of the West Country, including Bristol, Birmingham, and Worcester, was substantially higher than predicted, and that this is largely explained by falling wage rates and the evolution of an increasingly efficient travel network. Third, for the counties within about 130 kilometres of the capital, this article suggests that migration followed the pattern described in the current literature, with London drawing large numbers of local women in particular. It also argues that these short-distance migrants came from a uniquely wide number of parishes, suggesting a direct rural-to-urban path.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Modelling regional imbalances in English plebeian migration to late eighteenth-century London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "c46dbd69efcac2746db8f2e466bf6d07", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "The enabling local state and urban development", "Project Location - In London": "Barking Reach (51.51866519890048, 0.11269610003939269)", "Date": "1998", "Link": "https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000071993700001&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS&UsrCustomerID=f41074198c063036414efcbc916f8956", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1080/0042098984934", "Authors": "Yvonne Rydin", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Planning (51.526676177978516,-0.13003753125667572)", "Abstract": "Current literature on the new urban governance highlights the changes in patterns of relationships between actors at the local level, but also emphasises the continuing or even increasing importance of central government; in urban policy in particular there has been notable centralisation.

The paper then turns to the language of enabling as found in policy and academic literature and argues both that changes in the language of policy have been distinctive and that this is actively contributing to the new urban governance.

Never has so much anticipation and expectation been placed on one single area-based project. It is expected to simultaneously: generate new job opportunities for hard-to-reach groups of the unemployed; bring about the regeneration of some of Europe\u2019s most deprived neighbourhoods; lead to increases in sports participation; generate positive health outcomes; and even help to stave off recession in London by acting as a Keynesian boost in the midst of austerity (see for example The Economist (Citation2013)). For urban policy researchers the London Games thus represents a unique policy experiment; it is a location in which over \u00a310 billion of area-based expenditure has been mobilised at the same time as local communities have faced the biggest mainstream welfare cuts in a generation. A proper assessment of local impacts in this context should shed light on broader debates over the (in)effectiveness of area-based programmes in cities and whether development in an area leads to the development of that area.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Governance as legacy: project management, the Olympic Games and the creation of a London model"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "66dc5a789ea1aea655f949b8b069cdcc", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Addressing the Challenges of Last-Mile Parcel Delivery in London", "Project Location - In London": "Oxford Street (51.515392580542624, -0.14210447482449817)", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10068267/7/Allen_The%20scope%20for%20pavement%20porters_%20addressing%20the%20challenges%20of%20last-mile%20parcel%20delivery%20in%20London.pdf", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1177/0361198118794535", "Authors": "Allen J, Bektas T, Cherrett T, Bates O, Friday A, McLeod F, Piecyk M, Piotrowska M, Nguyen TB, Wise S", "London Authors": "Julian Allen\nMaja Piecyk\nMarzena Piotrowska\nFaculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster, London, NW1 5LS, U.K. (51.52247276109356, -0.15515765948151214)", "Other Author (National+International)": "Faculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, U.K. (50.936819958064014, -1.3968914464646387)\n\nOliver Bates\nAdrian Friday\nSchool of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4WA, U.K. (54.005634180522705, -2.7846567863720875)\n\nTom Cherrett\nFraser McLeod\nFaculty of Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, U.K. (50.96304549231337, -1.4237564509927056)\n\nTolga Bektas\nSouthampton Business School, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, U.K. (50.93690544854171, -1.4054031729965317)", "Department": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis  (51.5219612121582,-0.13562574982643127)", "Abstract": "The UK parcel sector generated almost \u00a39 billion in revenue in 2015, with growth expected to increase by 15.6% to 2019 and is characterized by many independent players competing in an \u201ceveryone-delivers-everywhere\u201d culture leading to much replication of vehicle activity.

The consensus around this belief has been almost unanimous, despite the contradiction between the idea of scarcity and that of vacancy. This paper explores the assumptions underpinning this contradiction to point to new ways of addressing the \u2018vacant land problem\u2019. Drawing on the work of Lefebvre and Massey, the paper suggests a dialectical framing of vacant land to understand how its socially constructed nature shapes its transformation. The paper reveals a static understanding of urban change behind the conceptualisation of Battersea Power Station and Silvertown Quays as \u2018bad places\u2019, which in turn legitimises and shapes their transformation.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, 5.1% of spending on groceries in 2013 was transacted online, an increase from 3.8% in 2010. (The level was 1.1% in 2003.) Transport researchers face serious gaps in empirical data coverage of this phenomenon, however, because regional and national travel surveys typically collect limited information with which to establish how in-store and online shopping relate to one another. To address this issue, the authors employed a well-established data resource in a novel approach. The UK Living Costs and Food Survey is traditionally used to track aggregate household expenditure patterns and to monitor price inflation. This study drew on the unique nature of the survey's expenditure diary, in which respondents recorded each item that they purchased during a 2-week period; respondents also recorded whether each shopping occasion was in-store or online. Empirically, it was found that shopping basket characteristics (types of products being purchased) were significantly linked with channel choice (online versus in-store). Furthermore, with a twostage modeling approach, it was found that sociodemographic factors appeared to relate in different ways to adoption of online shopping in general and to the choice of online versus in-store for individual shopping occasions. The paper closes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Empirical application of expenditure diary instrument to quantify relationships between in-store and online grocery shopping: Case study of greater London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "42feeafe31fd73046e6982cc4e1c4936", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "10.1017/err.2022.43", "Authors": "Patel K", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "In the international development and charity sector, particularly in the UK but not exclusively, crises of safeguarding vulnerable people have driven relatively large-scale investment in risk management and boosted its importance in charity governance. In 2018, British newspaper The Times published an expos\u00e9 of the international non-governmental organisation (INGO) Oxfam GB and its handling of allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct of its staff in Haiti and the Philippines (known colloquially as the \u201cOxfam-Haiti scandal\u201d). An investigation into Oxfam GB by the Charity Commission, a government body that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales, found that the organisation\u2019s safeguarding strategy, approach and resourcing were significant areas of weakness that meant \u201cthe charity exposed itself to undue risk, amounting to mismanagement in the administration of the charity\u201d.Footnote 1 The lever of exposure to risks \u2013 including the risk of causing harm to others alongside reputational risks \u2013 led to major sector-wide investment and the growth of teams of safeguarding professionals that introduced new or shored up existing policies, practices, lines of reporting and accountability and engendered behavioural change. By 2022, the international development and charity sector has become well versed and proactive in its management and mitigation of risks within the organisation and those caused by the organisation. These are risks that can be known, boxed into processes attentive to them and contained so that organisations may continue their substantive work. This framework and approach to understanding and managing risk as an operational exercise seems profoundly unsuited to the next great challenge facing the international development and charity sector and the development sector more widely \u2013 a challenge that aims to undo its rules and institutions and disrupt its very paradigm of knowing.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Journal article", "Title": "Decolonization, Development and Knowledge in Africa: Turning Over a New Leaf by Sabelo J.

In Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, safety is one of the foundational needs of well-being. The built environment should be safe to use at all times of the day and for all groups of people. After dark, the appearance of the outdoor environment changes dramatically, and this could impact the opportunities for crime. This study investigated the impact of daylight on the rates of different types of crime by comparing the crime rates during selected periods of daylight and darkness. The study used records of crime data from the Metropolitan Police Service. By studying crimes in the week on either side of the twice-yearly clock change, it is possible to compare periods that are dark in one week and light in the other at the same clock time. Where the time at which the crime took place was known, and using the GPS coordinates of the specific crime, the solar altitude was calculated and used to determine if it was light or dark at the time of the crime. A similar calculation was used to see if the crime would have been in the dark or light in the week on the other side of the clock change. The headline result is that there was 4.8% (OR 1.07) more crime in the dark periods than the light ones. However, this increase was not uniform across all crime types, and there were some further complications in some results due to potential changes in the behavior of some victims after dark. For the crimes of theft from a person and robbery of personal property, there was a significant increase during the dark period. The availability of light had an impact on the rate of certain crimes. Whilst this does not provide any information about the impact of street lighting on crime, it does provide some idea of by how much crime could be reduced if better lighting was provided.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location -

As a result, there is much research on the way neighbourhoods become the content of media and how media could be instrumentalised to improve local communities, but there is a lack of synthesis of media and built environment research allowing a nuanced understanding of the role of communication technology in neighbourhood life. This thesis addresses this gap in knowledge by developing a richer set of interlinked concepts and methods than that which is currently available to describe urban communications. Existing theoretical frameworks are expanded upon through critical development of a number of approaches to \u2018placing\u2019 the main hyperlocal news blog for one neighbourhood: mapping the locations it discusses; analysing the geographical and network characteristics of its social media network; and the development of grounded theory about the use of media in the neighbourhood through qualitative interviews.\nThe main arguments hold that even at the hyperlocal scale, theories of the national public sphere can help understand the way that imaginaries of place are formed through media; that a focus on subjective imaginaries and non-instrumental storytelling enables a better description of hyperlocal media use than on its instrumental value; and that neighbourhoods should be described as communication ecologies formed of multi-modal actor-networks of people, places, and technologies, rather than as separate spatial and virtual realities. The findings are largely methodological, demonstrating the possibility of placing media by mapping the issues it frames; of illustrating links between spatial morphology and the distribution of issues and social media networks; of using qualitative data to spatialize theories of the formation of the public sphere; and a proposition for a new method for building a socio-technical interaction network demonstrating the structure of the hyperlocal communication ecology.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Thesis / Dissertation", "Title": "The Blog and the Territory: placing hyperlocal media and its publics in a London neighbourhood"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "02d03e84b8cf539ba88c1838c771f742", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Griffiths S, Vaughan L, Haklay M, Sahbaz O", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "29-31 August 2007\n\nAbstract\nThis paper argues that the concept of \u2018sustainability\u2019 is best approached in terms of the factors favourable to the persistence of socio-economic activity in a given centre over time. It suggests that the question of how some places are able to\u2018re-invent\u2019 themselves over successive historical periods lies at the heart of what sustainability actually means.\n\nThe absence of a strong definition of sustainability, often misinterpreted as an exclusively environmental term, has impeded proper understanding of the temporality it strongly implies. This is particularly true in the field of urban design where the relation of the built environment to socio-economic change is poorly theorised and rarely integrated into methodology.\n\nThis issue is addressed in this paper by drawing on preliminary research conducted by the EPRSC\u2019s Successful Suburban Town Centres project which runs for three years at UCL. A critical examination of the literature of sustainability and an evaluation of relevant time-series datasets provided the basis for an heuristic methodology able to distinguish a wide range of \u2018successful\u2019 suburban town centres. The methodology comprises a series of filters and sorting criteria employing socio-economic, geographical, historical and morphological data, backed up with fieldwork where necessary and integrated into a GIS.\n\nThe selection process produced a sample of suburban centres all of which may be considered to be \u2018successful\u2019 in the sense that they continue to function effectively despite histories of socio-economic change and physical transformation. The explanation for this appears to lie in their distinctive combinations of socio-economic diversity and morphological robustness. For this reason it is asserted that the long-term \u2018success\u2019 of these suburban centres should be considered as a prerequisite rather than an outcome of \u2018sustainability\u2019 which is too abstract a term to sufficiently articulate the particularities of place.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location -

This research enhances standard walkability models with fieldwork that actively engages with the community to understand the factors that shape everyday mobility and walking behaviours. Amongst several factors, public transport accessibility was added as a spatial variable that contributes to walkability, whilst walkable land uses were selected to be appropriate to the specific (UK) context.\n \nThe model also incorporates an advanced method to evaluate the spatial structure of the street network instead of the standard approach of measuring intersection density. Here, space syntax network analysis methods are used, that examine the spatial relationship across the street network at a range of scales by looking at the geometric relationships between spaces. This method more closely accounts for spatial cognition and human wayfinding principles in the way that it uses the actual pedestrian routes taken through the urban environment as the basis for the evaluation of the street network. This method of assessing street network properties holds the potential for improving both walkability studies, and associated health research. It also aims to increase the awareness of the planning profession of the importance of the spatial arrangement and connectivity of the built environment in shaping walking behaviours, and enabling populations to live healthier lives through higher levels of active transport and physical activity.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference abstract/presentation slides", "Title": "Integrating community engagement and wayfinding principles into the development of a walkability index for London"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "066a762a819452d6a510e8612a2542dc", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Short MJ", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference abstract/presentation slides", "Title": "Tall building management in London: success or failure in enhancing the character of London?"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "99a9583380ce55d13cb6437076ecd4c7", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "", "Project Location - In London": "", "Date": "", "Link": "", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "", "Authors": "Mindell JS, Jones P, Haklay M, Scholes S, Groce N, Vaughan L", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "", "Abstract": "", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Conference abstract/presentation slides", "Title": "Community severance from major roads: Can we measure its effects on determinants of health?

One of the main determinants of returns from residential investment property is the income obtained from tenants\u2019 rent. Income return is affected by several factors, including residents\u2019 satisfaction and their loyalty (in renewing their lease). The ease with which a landlord can let vacant property also depends upon their reputation, the desirability of the neighbourhood, the rental terms and the properties themselves.\nThis paper analyses almost 5000 interviews with PRS tenants in the UK, conducted over a four-year period, to investigate determinants of resident satisfaction, loyalty (lease renewal) and willingness to recommend their landlord. Statistical analysis is performed using respondents\u2019 ratings of satisfaction with many aspects of their occupancy as explanatory variables. Comparisons are made between interviewees who renew their lease and those who do not renew.  \nThe research finds that \u201cease of doing business\u201d with their landlord is a strong predictor of residents\u2019 satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Other key indicators for lease renewal include relationship management, rent collection and value for money. Tenants\u2019 willingness to recommend their landlord depends mainly on their relationship with their landlord, how the landlord compares with tenants\u2019 previous landlords, and the property management service they receive.\nThis research should help to improve the landlord \u2013 tenant relationship in the Private Rented Sector", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location -

Conventional planning theory tends to assume a logical, rational and linear decision-making process, which bears little relationship to reality. This book aims to shed some light on that reality. The King\u2019s Cross scheme is one of the largest and most complex developments taking place in Britain today. The planning negotiations, which took six years, were probably some of the most exhaustive debates around a development ever. A report of over 600 pages of technical information was eventually presented to the committee, and after two evenings and ten hours of presentations and debate, the committee approved the scheme by just two votes.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Book", "Title": "Planning, Politics and City-Making: A Case Study of King's Cross"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "fd733824b0da79d9a16b100d7dda1eb0", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Walking Cities: London", "Project Location - In London": "London", "Date": "2020", "Link": "https://www.routledge.com/Walking-Cities-London/Joseph-Lester-King-Blier-Carruthers-Bottazzi/p/book/9780367407896", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "9.78037E+12", "Authors": "Jaspar Joseph-Lester, Simon King, Amy Blier-Carruthers, Roberto Bottazzi", "London Authors": "Jaspar Joseph-Lester, Simon King, RCA, (51.5011875, -0.1793125); Amy Blier-Carruthers, Royal Academy of Music, (51.5234375, -0.1516875)", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Walking Cities: London (second edition) brings together a new interdisciplinary field of artists, writers, architects, musicians, human geographers and philosophers to consider how a city walk informs and triggers new processes of making, thinking, researching and communicating. In particular, the book examines how the city contains narratives, knowledge and contested materialities that are best accessed through the act of walking.\n\nThe varied contributions take the form of short stories, illustrated essays, personal reflections and accounts of walks both real and fictional. While artist and RCA tutor Rut Blees Luxemburg and philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy recount a nocturnal journey from Shoreditch to the City of London; architect Peter St John of the practice Caruso St John offers a detailed and personal reflection on the Holloway Road; and architect and author Douglas Murphy examines what he calls London\u2019s \u2018more politically charged locations\u2019 in his account of a solitary walk through an area of South London.

At these events, new Company leaders symbolically received corporate endorsement by participating in investiture ceremonies in front of an elite group of Company members and their selected guests. Though all in attendance enjoyed lavish spreads of food and drink, each table received varying, carefully apportioned dishes designed to ensure honour and city hierarchies were upheld.\nAs a compilation of incredibly detailed accounts for many consecutive years of corporate dining, the Drapers\u2019 Company Dinner Book is extraordinary. It records the organisation of the Company\u2019s dinners and the supply of items of food and drink, as well as the names of guests in the hall and employees in the kitchen. Food gifts sent out after the dinner are recalled comprehensively (which on one occasion consisted of 162 venison pasties). During the period covered by the Dinner Book, new trading corporations and accelerated city growth began to undermine the economic powerbase of London guilds such as the Drapers. Dinner records indicate that the City companies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries recognised the potential of their annual Election Dinners to reinforce the antiquity of corporate authority, inferring a mythical past as a means of legitimizing their stake in the future.", "Partners": "", "Partnership Location - In London": "", "Partnership": "", "Policy Sources////Citations ( from Overton)": "", "Policy source subcategory": "", "Partnership 1": "", "Partnership 2": "", "Partnership 3": "", "Partnership 4": "", "Filter 2 (Themes)": "", "Funder 1": "", "Funder 2": "", "Funder 3": "", "Source": "RPS", "Output type": "Book", "Title": "The Dinner Book of the London Drapers' Company, 1564-1602"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": []}, "properties": {"UUID": "3652823b6689b9ab1140812f62daf26b", "Memory Mapper Title (keywords to identify the project) (should include the research content": "Survey of London: South-East Marylebone", "Project Location - In London": "Marylebone (51.5177, -0.147)", "Date": "2017", "Link": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Survey-London-South-East-Marylebone-Volumes/dp/0300221975", "Identification- DOI/URL/ISBN/Reference no.": "300221975", "Authors": "Philip Temple, Colin Thom, Andrew Saint", "London Authors": "", "Other Author (National+International)": "", "Department": "Bartlett School of Architecture (51.525972,-0.132386)", "Abstract": "Providing essential knowledge about the British capital\u2019s built environment, these two volumes cover a large portion of the parish of St. Marylebone, bounded to the south by Oxford Street and to the north by the Marylebone Road, and stretching from just west of Marylebone High Street to the parish boundary along Cleveland Street near Tottenham Court Road to the east.
